harvard
=======

A quick and dirty webapp to display searchable and filterable info about the class of 2018

###notes
if you try to load this, note that the required harvard.json file isn't there. That's intentional - I don't feel comfortable sharing people's information in that way. If you're a member of the Harvard Class of 2018 group, you can generate that yourself (I'll add instructions somewhere).

small things:
+ feel free to send me pull requests, etc.
+ if you're on this website, and don't want to be, send me a PM via facebook
+ comments are much appreciated
