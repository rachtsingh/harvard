I will be playing football at Harvard, cornerback.\n4. In high school, I never lost a single football game (56 and 0). I have four state championship rings, and the Bellevue football program has won 11 out of the last 13 state championships in Washington (6 straight).\n5. I have a twin brother, he looks nothing like me at all though! He is going to the University of Richmond and will play division 1 lacrosse.\n6. I have an older brother who also played football in college at eastern Washington university, he won a national championship in 2010. I also have a sister who went to the university of Oregon, she is a duck super fan. She has also always joked that Oregon is the Harvard of the west, so she found it pretty funny when I told her I was actually going to Harvard!\n7. I'm at a basketball tournament in Palm Springs, CA right now, and I was wearing a Harvard sweatshirt at In N Out last night. The guy taking my order asked me if I go there and when I said I will be next year, he got really wide eyed and proceeded to ask me very awkwardly about my test scores and GPA. Definitely one of the more head scratching experiences in my life lol\n8. I also play basketball. Basically my life for the past four years has consisted of sports and school, but it finally seems like the hard work is paying off!\n9. Chocolate. Nuff said.\n10. Mangoes are probably my favorite food.\n11. Guitar hero was my life in 6th and 7th grade. I spent way too much time playing it and consequently got really, REALLY good at it. Love all the music in those games too, never gets old.\n12. Music is really important to me! I can say I like almost all types of music, but country is not my thing. I also love EDM; kaskade, deadmau5, Eric prydz, disclosure, etc... Edm concerts are the best!\n13. I have an extreme hatred for Yale. When I was visiting schools over the summer, I went to Harvard before Yale (the flights just worked out that way), and when the football coaches at Yale found out, they took away my offer. They completely disrespected my parents (and when you mess with my mom, you're asking for an ass whoopin), and basically I want to demoralize them every year when we play them. YUCK FALE, they wish they were us!!!\n14. Seahawks. SEAHAWKS! Russell Wilson is the perfect human being.\n15. God have mercy, the Seattle Supersonics will come back one day :(\n16. My celebrity look alike is Matthew McCoughnahey from his high school days. Literally, it's really similar!\n17. It really doesn't rain that much in Seattle, it's just cloudy a lot. The summer weather is perfect though! If you ever come to Seattle, go during the summer, there's no better place in the world (biased I know).\n18. My favorite movie of all time is Step Brothers\n19. I have no clue what I want to study. At least we have two years to decide! I have a very open mind.\n20. I cannot wait to spend the next four years at Harvard. As long as I can get through the last three weeks of this semester, senioritis will probably kick in.

But here goes, regardless :P \n\n1. I was born in Johannesburg. Kind of like the elephant graveyard of South Africa, but moved to Cape Town aged 4. Thankfully. \n2. My parents are divorced. Mum lives near my old school in the urban center of Cape Town. Dad lives in a conservation village an hour outside of town. We've had running water for 10 years. And it's stunningly beautiful. \n3. I remember most of my life through the music that was playing at the time. \n4. I cry in the Lion King when Mufasa dies.. And in most movies, actually. Bit of a softie over here. \n5. My middle-name is Wandile - which means 'progress' in isiZulu. \n6. I'm straight, but would happily marry Tim Minchin. \n7. I'm obsessed with Jack Kerouac's work. \n8. When I was little, I used to compose comedic music sketches and perform them for my class and teachers. My mum shows the recordings to every friend I bring home. Which is exceedingly embarrassing. \n9. I love adventure sports. Lead climbing, surfing, diving. My friends are a lot braver than I am, and somehow drag me into doing things that are objectively really stupid. Diving with sharks minus the cage probably tops that list. :/ \n10. And yet it still takes me >5 minutes to tie my shoelaces. \n11. I've represented South Africa for debating and public speaking on several occasions, and probably talk far too much. \n12. I'm a total sucker for a Capella groups, and spend hours foraging through the internet in search of them. \n13. I've been playing the piano since I was six, but have never approached it competitively. Music is my core, and keeps me (relatively) sane. Not sane at all, actually. But having fun nonetheless. \n14. I've been a victim of a several armed robberies, GTA, muggings and physical assault, but will never stop loving South Africa. \n15. I have a serious case of wanderlust and am hoping to spend some time over the next couple months driving through Africa in a Jeep teaching maths and science. \n16. I unconsciously make the appropriate facial expressions when I read, which makes people around me laugh. It's worse when I read poetry.\n17. Sunsets make me happy - even though it's cliched to be made happy by sunsets. \n18. I can't dance. Not even a little bit. Instead, I balter. \n19. The only music I avoid is heavy rap and heavy metal. Otherwise I'll listen to everything. I've even been rumoured to sing along to 1D and JBiebs from time to time. \n20. Harvard has been a dream for as long as I can remember. The next few years are set to be incredible with all of you. Congratulations to all! \n\nBig love from down in Africa.

I've hiked the Himalayas, the Canadian Rockies, and the American Rockies. My favorites were probably the Canadian Rockies. Banff was so beautiful!\n8. I've always been a busy kid. When I was little I did gymnastics, soccer, Tae-Kwon-Do, took Korean classes, and swam. Now, I just swim. \"You can do anything, but you can't do everything.\" - David Allen\n9.

One of my favorite quotations: \"You can't stop the waves, but you can learn to surf.\" - John Kabat-Zinn.\n12.

I was born and raised in Curaçao, a teensy weensy island in the\nCaribbean. Our national anthem calls it a \"rock in the sea.\" Aaaah,\npatriotism.\n5. My four grandparents are from four different countries (Italy,\nSwitzerland, Curacao, and the Netherlands).\n6. If you ask me where I am from I may or may not have an existential\ncrisis in front of you.\n7. I've never lived anywhere with seasons other than \"rainy\" and \"dry\"\nso I'm excited about living in a place where it's socially acceptable\nto wear boots. I assume that excitement will fade when my Caribbean\nblood starts kicking in...... that made me sound like a reptile. D:\n8. I am not a reptile. Although if I was  a reptile, I'd want to be a\ndragon. Do dragons count as reptiles?\n9. I speak English, Dutch, Spanish and Papiamentu (an often very\nunoriginal creole we speak here). I'm learning Arabic and Italian.\n10. I took Arabic classes online for four years, and I'm uber excited\nto continue studying it. IF YOU SPEAK ARABIC, TALK TO MEEE (& then I\ncan smile and nod while actually having no clue what you're saying).\n11. The Arabic word of the day when I found out I was accepted was\n\"university.\" Coincidence? I think not.... Okay I think so.\n12. I was just in my school's production of Aladdin. I can't sing\nthough so I have no idea how that happened...\n13. Speaking of theater, I watched a theatrical performance on puns\nthe other day. It was really just a play on words.\n14. If you couldn't tell by now, my sense of humor is lame at best.\n15. So I'll pretty much listen to anything (except country -- sorry\ny'all) but I really love indie rock.\n15. I'm a proud supporter of the Oxford comma.\n16. I looooove Model UN. I'm chairing GA1 at THIMUN this year, so if\nany of you are going, we should meet up (& then become best friends).\n17. Words cannot express how excited I am for getting into a house.\nThe closest to Hogwarts I'll ever be since my letter was lost in the\nmail. :')\n18. I'm a shameless whovian and have still not emotionally recovered\nfrom the 50th. Also, if you talk to me about Sherlock, I will cry.\n19. I play the piano and the saxophone.\n20. I'm reading The Namesake by Jhumpa Lahiri right now & I freak out\nevery time she mentions Cambridge.\n\nBROWNIE POINTS IF YOU GOT THROUGH MY RAMBLING!

I know, I know, I'm pretty late with this! But here are 20 facts about me!\n1. I haven't introduced myself yet! I'm Cami, and I live in Manhattan Beach, which is a small beach town that's part of LA county. It's currently 78 degrees and I love it. Boston winter is going to be rough on me.\n2. I'm currently taking a gap year, and I'm having a great time! It's been a really good break, and I've gotten to do a lot of things that I normally wouldn't have been able to do. It's also made me miss and appreciate school. Imagine that! I seriously cannot wait to be at Harvard.\n3. I'm so excited that there's actually a Harvard Class of 2018 page now! I've been waiting for this for a solid few months haha\n4. I just spent a month working at an international school in South Korea, and in two weeks I'm headed to Senegal to volunteer at an orphanage for a month.\n5. I have a twin sister who goes to Juilliard for dance. we're pretty much best friends.\n6. I've done ballet all my life and really love it, although I'm not as serious about it as I used to be. I hope to get involved with dance on campus!\n7. I recently taught myself to play guitar. I'm pretty bad but it's fun anyways.\n8. I love Bob Dylan, The Smiths, the Stones, Simon and Garfunkel, Stevie Nicks, James Taylor, and a basically anything from the 60's and 70's. \n9. I did chorus in high school even though I'm probably the worst singer ever. It was fun.\n10. my favorite book is To Kill a Mockingbird.\n11. I love to write, and I journal kind of obsessively. \n12. I like fashion too, and I started a fashion column for my high school's newspaper which was pretty fun. \n13. I definitely want to write for the Crimson, and maybe even the Lampoon, even though I've heard it's really difficult to become a part of their writing staff.\n14. I really enjoy tv and movies. My favorite tv shows are Breaking Bad, Mad Men, the Mindy Project, 30 Rock (when it was still on), Modern Family, the Colbert Report, and Rachel Maddow.. Movie-wise I like Sixteen Candles, Ferris Beuller's Day off, The Breakfast Club, and Pretty in Pink. I also love Hitchcock and pretty much anything with Audrey Hepburn, as well as Juno, Inception, Django, Silver Linings Playbook, and Argo. \n15. I don't really know what I want to study, but I think it would be pretty awesome to be able to write for TV or something. I'm not a huge math/science person.\n16. My mom is from Paris, so I grew up speaking French at home, and I visit my family in France every summer.\n17. My favorite color is red. always has, always will be.\n18. I've lived in California my whole life, so I'm really excited to live on the east coast for a while! Real seasons!\n19. Anyone else know about Rookiemag.com? \n20. I'm so excited to meet all of you guys! You all seem like such interesting, sincere, amazing people, and I couldn't ask for anything better!","picture":"https://fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net/hprofile-ak-prn2/1118911_870405520_853980299_q.jpg"},{"from":{"name":"Alessandro Ferzoco","id":"100005574193572"},"to":{"data":[{"name":"Harvard Class of 2018","id":"601401026562908"}]},"message":"Hi everyone, I just joined this group a little while ago. Looks like the Class of 2018 is going to be awesome! Looking forward to meeting all of you. Here are a few things about me; they're ones I can think of: \n\n1. I’ve always lived in Boston – it’s an amazing city. “Because I love that dirty water/ Oh, oh, Boston, you're my home” ( don’t worry, the Charles River isn’t actually dirty anymore, that song was written in the 1960s)\n2. I’m 6’5’’ tall. \n3. My family really values our Italian heritage. I speak a little dialect, but want to study real Italian. \n4. For three years consecutive years I won first place in Mayor Menino’s Citywide Garden Contest for the City of Boston. I grow fruits and vegetables – it’s one of my main hobbies. It’s my own 1500 sq ft. one man urban farm.  \n5. I love food and family and friends and good conversation, and especially Italian food.  \n6. I come from a big family; My dad is one of 17 kids and I have 50 first cousins, and almost all of them live in and around Boston. \n7. I’ll try any music from Caruso to Eminem – might not like it, but I’ll give it a chance. \n8. I was a huge House MD fan, haven’t really found a replacement TV show recently. I’ve been told to watch Sherlock, Breaking Bad, House of Cards – now that I’m allowed to have a life, since the college application process is over, I hope to catch up on some TV.\n9. I like to read and write.\n10. I have lots of nicknames \n11.    I spend a lot of my time during the summers on Cape Cod\n12. My parents and most of my relatives speak with a Boston accent, I sometimes have one – “Pahk tha cah in Hahvahd Yahd” \n13. I have chickens (we don't eat them), even though we live in the city. \n14. I’ve recently read: Of Human Bondage, The Grapes of Wrath, the Stranger, One Hundred Years of Solitude, Slaughterhouse-Five, Cat’s Cradle, The Sun Also Rises. Suggest books, I’ll read them\n15. I like playing cards and board games\n16. I enjoy arguing, like many of you here. \n17. I’m a humanities guy – I’m not particularly a fan of math \n18. I’ve enjoyed studying Ancient Greek for the past 2.5 years and am looking forward to taking courses in classics in college\n19. I visited Italy for the first time last March – It was a life changing experience. I hope to take advantage of some summer opportunity to spend some time there \n20. Don’t really know where I stand on the political spectrum- always open to new ideas.","picture":"https://fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net/hprofile-ak-ash2/1076496_100005574193572_1063457677_q.jpg"},{"from":{"name":"Griffin Gonzales","id":"100006746827279"},"to":{"data":[{"name":"Jake Foley","id":"12772"},{"name":"Harvard Class of 2018","id":"601401026562908"}]},"message":"Hi y'all! Tooootally late to the 20 facts party, but here we go:\n\n1. I live in Portland, Oregon.\n2. I didn't tell either parent I applied to Harvard. When I let them know I applied and was admitted my mom said \". . . which Harvard?\" They are very happy but also very confused.\n3. I own a poster business called \"Posters For Education\", I make and sell fun history posters and then donate lots to classrooms. Here's one of the websites for one of the posters if you want to take a look: TableofPresidents.com\n4. My interviewer Jim and I high fived fifty three times, we counted.\n5. I do not speak with a southern accept despite opening with \"high y'all!\", I just assume that makes me sound friendlier and more likable among this strange pool of non-Oregonians and quasi-geniuses.\n6. I'm applying to three other schools, just in case the money doesn't work out at Harvard (although I hope it does, and am sure it will).\n7. My bedroom is really seven rooms which I took from the rest of my family of 6. Given how much space I have now, dorms next year is going to be hard and I may cry on all of your shoulders.\n8. I went to Spain once.\n9. While in Spain I bought a sword, and brought it back home as a present for my younger brother but kept it for myself instead because it is real cool.\n10. I don't watch TV and I listen to audiobooks and podcasts a lot. \n11. I sometimes do standup comedy in Portland, and I'm like not bad, but I am most certainly not good.\n12. The local Harvard alumni association here invited me to a steak luncheon in which I will have to eat steak but I DO NOT LIKE STEAK but don't tell them because I want to fit in.\n13. I will probably wear a tuxedo and a monocle to try and fit in. \n14. Mr. Jake Foley sir, I've been told by my interviewer to refer all my questions to you. Do you know what kind of attire is expected at the Oregon and Southwestern Washington Harvard Alumni Association lunches? Tuxedos? Monocles? Do I bring my own butler or are they provided? \n15. I am likely working under the assumption that Harvard is much fancier than it really is. Everybody here seems wonderful and kind and brilliant and not John F. Kennedy.\n16. Can I double major in Political Science and History?\n17. That wasn't really a fact, but aren't questions the real facts? \n18. Fact: I just blew your mind.\n19. It's 1 in the morning, I'm in the suburbs of Sacramento California visiting family, I just saw Anchorman 2 and it was great so now I'm feeling just a little bit too much moxy. I should probably think of 20 better and more insightful facts. Also I went back and edited this after posting and subsequently deleting it because I misspelled \"y'all\".\n20. My cousin Chelsea just came down to the fridge to get milk and she wants to know \"Why are you awake?\" I told her I'm working and then asked her why she was getting milk and then she said goodnight and left. If anybody knows why you would need milk at 1 in the morning, please let me know. \n\nThanks for listening; I can't want to meet all of you in the future! You all seem incredible and -- if my informant in the Yale '18 group is to be believed -- a billion times better than the Yale class of 2018, but we can love them anyway.\n\nG'night y'all.","message_tags":{"1716":[{"id":"12772","name":"Jake Foley","type":"user","offset":1716,"length":10}]},"picture":"https://fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net/hprofile-ak-prn2/1118701_100006746827279_193625556_q.jpg"},{"from":{"name":"Dylan Clark","id":"623852394"},"to":{"data":[{"name":"Aidan Dewar","id":"100002142725115"},{"name":"Harvard Class of 2018","id":"601401026562908"}]},"message":"Hey guys, its been 2 weeks so I figure I better get in on this 20 facts thing.\n1. I'm Dylan from Dallas, TX\n2. I was actually born in Leeds, England but have lived in Dallas most of my life. Only child with divorced parents since I was 2, so its the only reality i've known and I love it. 2 of every holiday!\n3. I have tons of family in Boston (12 cousins, 6 sets of uncles and aunts, and a grandma), so I'm super pumped to be going to school up there.\n4. Not ALL texas stereotypes are true. I don't have an accent but we do all ride horses to school and keep them in the stables. (The rich kids ride in carriages).\n5. I do say \"y'all\" a lot. \n6. I play basketball for my high school's team. Not very good. Classmate Aidan Dewar actually plays though. \n7. Our basketball team has 2 kids going to harvard, 2 going to princeton, and one going to stanford. Pretty crazy. \n8. I'm big into the netflix game. Breaking Bad>Life. Also a huge fan of Its Always Sunny, HIMYM, Dexter, Walking Dead. Getting into homeland after I finish this post.\n9. #4 was a joke. My sense of humor is exclusively sarcasm. \n10. Every summer until last year I went to a summer camp in Raymond, ME called Timanous. Any other sebago lakes region campers here? i was a counselor for the last two years and loved it.\n11. At the camp I became one of the head sailing counselors because all I did was spend my time sailing as a camper and did pretty well in intra-camp regattas. \n12. My school is an all-boys day school so a lot of the humor there is probably misogynistic and/or inappropriate. Our sister school got 3 girls into Harvard early so shootout to them. \n13. I wrote my common app essay about a nickname I didn't like and somehow Harvard liked it.\n14. I'm the editor in chief of my schools newspaper, The ReMarker. It's the biggest time commitment of my life and super hard work to manage everyone and get the paper out each cycle, but I love it. \n15. My \"25 most played\" on iTunes consists of Kanye, Childish Gambino, Chance the Rapper, A$AP, Kendrick Lamar, and Dispatch.\n16. OH another fun non-stereotypical texas fact I'm a pretty far-left liberal. Socially at least. Not sure about economically. To fellow texans I'm \"a dirty socialist\" though.\n17. Last summer I worked in a lab outside of Boston trying to optimize a new type of solar-cell technology called Dye-sensitized solar cells. \n18. Since my dads family is all from boston, I was raised a big time red sox/celts/patriots fan. It's kinda convenient that they've all been amazing this decade. \n19. Super excited about getting into the big H. We have instant credibility for the rest of our lives and will have so many doors opened for us. So lucky. \n20.

Here are my 20 facts - they're late because I would much rather read these posts than write something on my own. Ya'll need to STAHP posting such interesting things or I'll never leave Facebook. Anyway...\n\n1. Born in Philly, raised in Pittsburgh since I was 2.\n2. I do a lot of singing, dancing and acting, although I’m only slightly above average at all three. So, basically, I am a pair of half-hearted jazz hands.\n3. I belt out show tunes and old U2 songs in the shower LIKE IT’S MY JOB. \n4. Will probably concentrate in English or Visual Studies, but I tell my crazy Indian tiger parents Biomedical Engineering to appease them.  \n5. I run weekly assemblies at my school, which basically involves me flailing my arms and being weird to entertain the student body. I think I’m really funny, and the 2/500 kids who laugh at my jokes think so too.\n6. I’m not out of shape per se, but I do possess a stunning lack of athletic ability. I waddled cross-country for three years, if that counts.\n7. Love movies. My favorites are (500) Days of Summer, Amelie, the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and anything Tarantino. And I quote Mean Girls on the daily, so…that.\n8. I wish I could bake a cake made out of rainbows and smiles and everyone would eat it and be happy. I’m sorry…I just have a lot of feelings. #GlenCoco4Evaaaa\n9. TV: Parks and Recreation, Saturday Night Live, The Walking Dead, SUMMER HEIGHTS HIGH. Music: Florence + the Machine, Lana Del Rey, the Killers, more alternative stuff.\n10. One time I got hit in the face by a human lung.\n11. Suffer from a crippling addiction to Youtube clips of foreign reality singing competitions, the best of which is the Voice of Holland. Literally no idea what anyone is saying but THEY ALL SOUND SO GOOD.\n12. Also addicted to creative acoustic or a capella covers of unexpected songs. Honestly if anyone needs videos of talented people in general let me know because I have an ungodly amount saved. Like, it’s disgusting.\n13. I can name every capital city in the world because I was a very weird child.\n14. Favorite animals are the hippopotamus, platypus, and the mythological hippoplatymus. \n15. I lerrrrve italics. In my three Harvard essays, I used them nine times.\n16. Really enjoy traveling, and my favorite place in the world is Bruges, Belgium. If you’ve never been, GO NOW. Go. Right now.\n17. Current obsession is QuizUp; I have my Facebook account to play with friends, and my secret account so my friends don’t realize how much I actually play QuizUp.\n18. I love all Asian cuisines (Thai, Vietnamese, and Indian are favorites), chocolate- covered pretzels with bananas, and thoroughly believe that a great chocolate-chip cookie can change the world.\n19. My one regret in high school is that I never made time to read for pleasure, especially now that I’m considering English as a primary field of study. I’m hoping to do that in the coming months, unless the X Factor Ukraine is particularly splendiferous.\n20. I’m simultaneously fascinated by, terrified of, and in love with everyone in this group, and will probably stay that way for the next four years. So, so lucky to be a part of this class.

My name is Romana, and I’m from Bethel, CT.\n2. I was born in the U.S, but I learned to speak Croatian before I knew English because both my parents were born in Croatia. \n3. I love languages and traveling, and I’ve studied abroad in Spain on two separate occasions during the summer (including this past summer where I learned how to use Madrid’s metro system!). \n4. The smiley is my favorite emoticon :)\n5. My main form of exercise in the winter and summer is running to things that I am late for. When I’m off season for that, I run varsity cross country and track. I plan on continuing to run at the intramural level in college. (Anyone wanna be running buddies?)\n6. I played the viola for six years, but I cannot sing in tune. This does not stop me from trying.\n7. I love spoken word poetry, and I recently saw Sarah Kay perform live, which was both exciting and inspirational.\n8. The first time I tried to ski was last winter! My technique was less than stellar, but I had a lot of fun. The fake snow machines were especially fantastic :P\n9. My hair does not believe in good hair days. This has caused me much grief on picture days throughout the years.\n10. I’m a ballroom dancer! I’ve been dancing since 5th grade, and I encourage you all to try it at least once.\n11. I enjoy writing ‘to-do’ lists. \n12. I enjoy crossing things off of my ‘to-do’ lists.\n13. I’m the Battalion Commander of my school’s NJROTC unit, but I’m not pursuing any ROTC scholarships.\n14. I usually start writing essays out longhand before transferring them to a computer.\n15. Wouldn’t this be fun if it were 19 truths and a lie?\n16. In my spare time, I enjoy raising awareness for my school’s literary arts magazine, Mirage, by posting (witty?) statuses about it. The deadline for submissions is January 9th, for those of you who were wondering. \n17. I’ve been a mock trial-er since 7th grade, and it has done wonders for my memorization, presentation, and public speaking skills.\n18. I have recently become an avid scarf enthusiast.\n19.

Along the same lines, I love learning languages and meeting people from other cultures\n10. I play the viola and sometimes violin, in 4 orchestras\n11. Thanks to my mom's love for the place, I've been to Disney World more times than I can count\n12. For my calculus final last year, me and some friends made a rap. It's on youtube under \"UOENO Calc Remix\"\n13. The top places I would like to visit are Rio de Janeiro, Tokyo, and Venice\n14. I had my appendix removed...random, but still cool\n15. In school I'm on the Mock Trial and Model UN teams, I do other stuff, but those are probably the most fun\n16. My favorite books right now are the Song of Ice and Fire series (Game of Thrones) and right now I'm on a Feast for Crows\n17. My favorite musical artist is by far Drake and I went to his concert at the Barclay's Center back in October\n18. I'm a pretty big movie guy. RIght now, my favorite movies are the Dark Night Trilogy, Skyfall, and Taken\n19. I just about only wear Under Armour, outside of dress clothes, and they've tweeted at me a few times, @princedevhurt if you want to follow\n20.

The last few weeks have been very busy for me, and finding a time to come up with 20 facts was difficult until now. \nHere they are (better late than never): \n\n1. I live in Newton, MA (around 25 min from Cambridge). I was born in Boston, but my family moved to Westchester, NY for 7 years until we came back here in 2004. I’m not really sure whether I’m a New Yorker or Bostonian at heart, so I gave up thinking about it a few years ago.\n2. I go to a pretty big public school, and I like the fact that I can always come across new people there (even in my senior year). I’m really excited to enter an even bigger pond next year.\n3. I have two sisters, but we are REEEALLLY spread out. That is, my older one is 23 and my younger one is 7. Yeah. \n4. I love science, particularly chemistry and physics. I’m very confident that I would like to focus on science in college, and I’m pretty confident that I would like to hone in on these two particular fields. I’ve had the privilege of working in a research lab for the past two summers, and I think it’s awesome.\n5. I also love to draw. I’ve loved it since I was little. I hope that I might be able to make graphical illustrations for the Crimson, and I look forward to exploring the ways I can keep drawing in college.\n6. I’m a squash player. I think it’s an awesome sport. I’ve been playing competitively since 6th grade, and I participate in as many local, regional, and national tournaments as I can. I haven’t been focusing on it as much in the past few months (hooray for senior fall!!) but I plan to train hard in the coming months in the hopes of playing for Harvard.\n7. I also really enjoy skiing. But I learned to ski out West, and my friends make fun of me because I’m useless on any Northeastern mountain. I don’t blame them.\n8. I love movies. LOVE them. They are the go-to activity for my friends and me. I can’t really call myself a ‘movie connoisseur’ because there are still a ton of classics that I haven’t seen, but I’ve seen most of the movies from this fall that are worth seeing. Some of my favorite films are The Social Network, Inception, Fight Club, and Captain Phillips.\n9. I don’t watch a ton of TV, but I do watch The Walking Dead (gotta love dem zombies) and SNL. Also, although I can’t say it’s a very good show, I’ve kept up with Agents of Shield (Marvel is my guilty pleasure. So pumped for Avengers 2). Finally, if you ever watched Avatar: The Last Airbender, you have my eternal respect.\n10. I like video games, but I don’t play them very much any more. \n11. I try to keep a 10-foot distance between me and anything that crawls and has an exoskeleton. \n12. I’m not super picky with music, alhtough I’m really getting sick of pop radio. But I do like Imagine Dragons, The Killers, and soundtrack music. Also, I wish I could whistle.\n13. If I had to pick one food to eat every day for the rest of my life, it would be a burrito from Anna’s Taqueria (for those of you who are local, I hope you get me here ☺)\n14. Both of my parents went to Harvard, so I’m lucky enough to know a lot about the traditions and lifestyle already.\n15. I haven’t gotten the chance to read for pleasure in a while, so that’s how I hope to spend a lot of the coming summer.\n16. I love tossing a frisbee with friends. Having a toss or playing Ultimate with people in the Yard is one of the down-time activities I’m most excited about for next year.\n17. I don’t really watch sports much (I’d rather play them), but I do follow the Olympics.\n18. For those of you who like physics, some friends and I did a “Thrift Shop” parody called “Newton: the Original G’” and posted it on YouTube. You guys should check it out. Not one of us can rap. \n19. I got my wisdom teeth removed today. It sucks. I feel like a chipmunk.\n20. So pumped to meet you all at Visitas!\n\nHappy Holidays everyone!","picture":"https://fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net/hprofile-ak-prn2/1119587_100001231801726_1397430163_q.jpg"},{"from":{"name":"Stephanie Campbell","id":"1397461081"},"to":{"data":[{"name":"Harvard Class of 2018","id":"601401026562908"}]},"message":"Hey, everyone! I’m going to take a shot to give you as much info about me with these 20 facts. The reason I am posting this so late is because I had deactivated my social media accounts for almost 3 years, and just got Facebook back 3 days ago! Today, I’m also making Twitter (@_stephcampbell) and Instagram (@_stephanicampbell) accounts. YAY social media!!\n\n1. I didn’t introduce myself yet - my name is Stephanie Campbell (random but no middle name) and I was born/live in Providence, Rhode Island. \n\n2. My name doesn’t sound Hispanic, but I am half Colombian. My mom was born and raised in Colombia. She met my dad - who was travelling to Bogota to practice his Spanish - and they proceeded to get married and have me!\n\n3. I’m an only child!\n\n4. I attend Lincoln School: an all-girls independent Quaker school (only one in the country - one of two in the world), which I have been going to since I was 3 years old. It’s very small - less than 400 girls (K-12), and 39 girls in the whole senior class.\n\n5. My mom works at the same school -- we’re very close.\n\n6. Apart from my studies at Lincoln, I spent a year (7th grade) studying abroad in France. I love studying languages. Spanish was my first language. I learned English in preschool. I picked up French through lessons and my time immersed abroad. I have family scattered all over the world - but I have quite a few family members in Brazil and because of the similarities between Portuguese and Spanish, I was able to learn yet another tongue. In school, I’ve been studying Arabic for 5 years.\n\n7. My all-time favorite subject has been Physics. I’ve always leaned towards maths and sciences.\n\n8. I complement my studies with art. At school, I’m part of the Art Major Honors Program. I also take weekly figure drawing classes and I am a member of local art studios.\n\n9. I’ve played tennis, done swimming, and running throughout my four years of high school. However, I am currently injured - I have a fracture at the bottom of my spine, which is frustrating because I haven’t been able to do pretty much any physical activity in over 3 months.\n\n10. The club I’ve dedicate the most time to would have to be debate. I’ve been a member since freshman year, and participating in tournaments has helped my public speaking and organization of thought tremulously. A couple months ago, I came in 1st place at a state tournament!\n\n11. Enough with school and extra-curriculars… Let’s see… I LOVE food. Anything really - I’m willing to try anything and everything. Especially if is spicy.\n\n12. I’m obsessed with dresses. Any excuse/event to get one, I will. They take over my closet!\n\n13. My lucky number is 13 (even though it is usual associated with being unlucky - but hey! we all got good news on Friday the 13th, so maybe not so much!) For some reason, I thought we’d be hearing back from Harvard the following Monday - or just later on - so I was completely taken by surprise when I got the email. \n\n14. I LOVE travelling - it’s my thing with my mom. We went backpacking through Europe one summer, which was my absolutely one of my favorite memories with her. We are also planning a trip to China over March break -- which I’m super excited for! It’ll be my 49th country.\n\n15. My favorite country as a whole to visit is Italy. My favorite three cities would have to be Prague, Vienna, and Rio de Janeiro.\n\n16. I take so many pictures! I have no shame in looking like a total tourist.\n\n17. Fall is my favorite season. I love the leaves falling, fun events, Halloween, fall fashion, etc. However, I’m so happy I live (and will go to school) in a region that has 4 seasons -- it’s exciting to switch things up!!\n\n18. I’m such an outdoors person, which kind of makes me lean towards warmer weather because I like to be active. Walking is my main mode of transportation. \n\n19. I lifeguard and teach swim lessons. I also spent a summer teaching English at an elementary school in Brazil.\n\n20. I want to do the Fall Cleanup before classes start in September. Anyone else thinking about that? I can’t wait to meet all of you very soon, and I’m glad we can get in touch on this group!!","picture":"https://fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net/hprofile-ak-ash2/186473_1397461081_2132893212_q.jpg"},{"from":{"name":"Andrew Gordon","id":"1272986066"},"to":{"data":[{"name":"Harvard Class of 2018","id":"601401026562908"}]},"message":"20 facts about Andrew Gordon:\n1:I'm on a gap year in Israel right now, I got here four months ago, Before that, I lived in Deerfield Illinois.\n2:I recently (a month ago) decided to become vegetarian.

(However, I never call them by their names because the only word they respond to is \"food\")\n8. I have a ball of energy for a sister (13). \n9.

I got really quiet and started to shake so violently that I could barely tell my teacher the news.\n18. I am quite into botany even though I am pursuing a degree in neuroscience.\n19. I hate going to bed but I also hate getting out of bed. Dilemma...\n20. I don't think I truly understand that next year I'll be waking up in Cambridge, MA.

I say “y’all,” but I’ve heard from Northerners that I don’t have an accent—other than the “y’all” thing. \n2. That being said, anything below 75 degrees is cold. I’ve heard that in Cambridge one adjusts to the temperature relatively quickly, so if that’s true, I’ll be fine. If not, I’ll be the person wearing 10 layers of clothing by the end of October.  \n3. I don't plan on fencing at Harvard, but I've been on my school's varsity team all four years, and I really love it! \n4. Music is one of my passions.

My older brother (the guy in my prof pic) is a sophomore at Harvard. We are really close. \n18. Had I not gotten into Harvard, I would be frantically trying to finish 8 other apps right now. \n19.

Apparently, I can get into Harvard but I can't give change at a concession stand… go figure.\n18. I've been a 4H member for the past 10 years, which has given me the opportunity to pursue a multitude of projects, including rabbits, entomology, foods, arts, and \"horseless horse\".\n19. Right now 20 facts really seems like a lot...\n20.

I've been waiting half a year to say my twenty tiny tidbits--actually I barely found out about this cool way to share who you are this week :) \nAnyway!\n\n1. I was born in Los Angeles and I haven't lived elsewhere besides the surrounding cities, so I'm really looking forward to this next year!\n\n2. I love learning! I know doh!, right? But I like it so much that I end up being a dabbler in many different things that I never progress much farther than just knowing the bare of things :(\n\n3. Love pretty much anything that explores the human condition or mind! This includes, but is not limited to: poetry, theories of mind, biology, neuroscience, culture studies, government, movies, books, any media pretty much... I'm basically a regular person, except that I like reading into the motives, emotions, and thoughts that were used to create the media! \n\n3. I'm not so great at math and tend to make tiny mistakes with it. Anyone willing to help me, please do! Although, having said that, I love math!! Who thinks Maths exists vs it's a language we use to explain the world??\n\n5. I have four brothers and sisters and I love them equally xp! Enzo, 15, Bella, 17, Madeline, 21 and Rome, 3... Guess my age!\n\n6. I tend to reference pop culture in the jokes I make, so I might sound crazy to some people who don't get the context XD\n\n7. I love bike riding! I love bikes in general and like fixing them too! I ride fixed gear bikes and bmx but I'm no Matt Hoffman (that guy still relevant?)\n\n8. I really want a record player now      although I'll settle with a friend to show me music through there vinyl collection!\n\n9. I'm so laidback that procrastination for me means that I'm being productive because I at least have gotten myself something to do!\n\n10. I've only been to two concerts (kinda). A music festival called Jubilee in DT LA where a great band called the Drums played, and the Yeezus tour, though I like to call him Kanye.\nI'm dying to see a Coldplay concert in person and anyone who could hook that up would make someone's life!!\n\n11. I don't believe in Santa Claus but I do believe in the magic of Christmas.\n\n12. I try to be clever and witty but most of the time comes off as cheesy--for the gluten free peeps-- or corny--for my soy-loving friends. I might be lactose intolerant (that might be too much info...)\nAnyway...\n\n13. I rate you all a ten for getting into Harvard, but tbh you all are strangers :p\n\n14. I can't wait to take pictures (yes I'm a tourist) in Boston and surrounding cities!! If anyone's DTE (down to explore) just hmu and we'll find some cool places to visit or maybe you could show me your places!\n\n15. I love learning about quantum physics and theories about what kind of universe we live in!! Holographic interior? Anyway, I suck at the math behind it, but I love a good layman's explanation, so yeah hopefully I find someone who'd enlighten me on that.\n\n16. I barely started practicing guitar because I have nothing else to do really!\n\n17. I use exclamation points entirely too much!! \n\n18. I like the color green a lot and am into the hippie culture but am not in it. Does that even make sense? No! Well watch Into the Wild ( read it too!) and that'll explain something... Oh I love writing stories and poetry!! But I don't do it too much :(\n\n19. I'm on a gap year and I've had the most experience in the real world and dealing with other people than ever before (I was a bookworm) and also I've watched way too many movies (I plan to watch all the Oscar award-winning films) and read too much, but am loving this SLEEP! Oh god this year was totally worth the sleep!!\n\n20. I'm a pretty down-to-Earth-at-about-9.8 m/s guy, and I can't wait to finally meet the greatest minds and people of my generation!! Hopefully I befriend the next Mark Z. and then I'll just leach off that person! \n\nHonestly though, I can't wait to step into the future and find out what awaits me at Hogwarts-- I mean Harvard!! I can't believe I'm going, and everyone here who decides to go could be my next dorm or classmate maybe even best friend !! It's been half a year and it's still such a magical thought!  Can't wait to Pahk mah cahr in Hahvard Yahd!!

I know I'm a little behind, but finals are over for me and I am finally somewhat settled into winter break, so I thought I would jump on the better-late-than-never bandwagon.  Here are my 20 facts:\n\n1. I grew up in LA and moved to Santa Monica a few years ago (I still technically live in LA County).\n2. After moving to Santa Monica, I decided I should learn to surf at least a little.\n3. Having lived in Southern California my entire life, I have basically no conception of cold weather -- or weather for that matter.\n4. I love playing the banjo.  Not terribly well, but I still love playing.\n5. I love reading, but I definitely watch more T.V. than I read books.\n6. Top Gear, Malcolm in the Middle, Breaking Bad, House, and Scrubs are some of my favorite shows\n7. On a similar note, I am a big fan of the Cohen brothers and Akira Kurosawa (slightly different styles of movie, I know).  Also, The Room.\n8. I'm not very athletic, but I do play volleyball at my school.\n9. The only sport I really follow is Formula 1.\n10. I'm very interested in cars and probably read too much Jalopnik.\n11. I love animals and currently have a mini pinscher, a beagador, and a ragdoll cat (all guys).\n12. I have studied Chinese for the past six years.\n13. I'm interested in computer science and technology in general.\n14. I still don't really know what I want to study.\n15. I listen to Earl Scruggs (banjo), the Grateful Dead, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Massive Attack, DJ Shadow, Nas, Outkast, A Tribe Called Quest, others that I'm not thinking of right now…\n16. My brother goes to USC's School of Cinematic Arts.\n17. I'm Jewish, but I still celebrate Christmas.\n18. I'm so happy to be a second semester senior and to be done with writing college apps right now (I think I would have been writing at least ten more between last Friday and New Year's day).\n19. I still can't believe that I'm going to Harvard next Fall!  I'm just waiting to find out that my acceptance letter was a mistake…\n20.

I'm from New York City - specifically I grew up on the Upper East Side but now I live in Harlem \n2. I'm a citizen of the US and of Germany - my mom is just a citizen of Germany but keeps saying she's going to study for a citizenship test here. Any other Germans here?!\n3. I love reading! My favorite authors are Jeffrey Eugenides and John Green. I love their books and also Franny and Zooey by Salinger, the Harry Potter books, and The Perks of Being a Wallflower \n4. My favorite Harvard related books (okay only ones I've read...) are Hacking Harvard and Prozac Nation\n5. I'm a policy debater and it's pretty great. I think I want to debate at Harvard\n6. I've gone to camp for debate every summer in High School - I went to MSU, Umich, and Dartmouth for camp \n7. The first person I called after being accepted was my Grandpa and he was super happy \n8. I've been to Germany, Holland, Italy, Spain, and Brazil \n9. I really want to study abroad during college \n10. I think I want to take German, Chinese, or Arabic at Harvard \n11. My favorite musical artists are Lorde, Birdy, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Florence and the Machine but that's subject to change constantly\n12. I think I watch so much TV because I'm making up for not having TV as a kid. My favorite shows are Game of Thrones, Newsroom, Awkward, and the Vampire Diaries\n13. I want to major in Economics, Government, or Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies (sorry should I say \"concentrate in?\")\n14. I spend too much time on Youtube. I really like a bunch of fashion youtubers from the UK but their videos also make me sad because I can't buy a bunch of the stuff they show. I also love spoken word poetry - I think it's so powerful and beautiful \n15. When my friend got into Yale my response was \"CONGRATS I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU\" then \"But I also hate you now\" \n16. My two favorite favorite dishes are pad thai and soon doo boo\n17. I have a little sister who goes to LaGuardia School for the Arts (which is the school the movie Fame is based off of). She goes for singing which makes it very hard to yell at her about singing loudly in the house because she'll always say she's practicing\n18.

I took a few days to recuperate from first semester but here are my 20 facts :)\n\n1. I was born in Paris and I have lived between Paris and Boston basically my entire life. I am currently living in Paris and I go to the American School of Paris.\n2. Consequently I am American and French, but I am also partially Tunisian because I have a biological dad who is Tunisian.\n3. I’m an only child and family is really important to me but I also can’t wait to live in a dorm room with people my age.\n4. I’m obsessed with pugs because I have one who is really fat and adorable in my eyes.\n5. I’m not the best at sports but I love to snowboard, play tennis, and scuba dive. I’m also a black belt in taekwondo but I received it a few years back so I’ve lost a lot of the moves; I can still count to ten in Korean though!\n6. I also love to bike or roller blade on sunny days. When I lived in Boston my dad and I would always go on this bike path and in Paris they have this bike system called Vélib that lets you rent bikes really easily so my friends and I like to go biking regularly.\n7. I love creative writing and I’ve been writing in a journal since I can remember (half of it is filled with quotes I really like). \n8. I love food but I am not great at cooking because my mom is always making amazing meals and doesn’t need me. I plan to learn though, and for my graduation present my mom is making me a cookbook with all her classic recipes. \n9. I’m shy when you first get to know me but once I feel comfortable, I’m very open.\n10. Along those lines I’m not a natural born public speaker but ironically I have been actively involved in MUN for four years now and it’s been such a rewarding experience.\n11. I absolutely love to travel.\n12. I love games and I jump at any opportunity to make a treasure hunt. One time a friend of mine and I were on vacation and she was sad about something so I made her a treasure hunt with one of the clues in a bottle floating in the pool. \n13. I love the holidays. On Halloween I always get really enthusiastic about pumpkin carving. In France people aren’t very holiday oriented so I’m looking forward to all the decorations in the states.\n14. A philosophy I find to be really important is that before jumping to conclusions about people and judging them, you should first consider their past, how they’ve been raised and the circumstances they’ve been through. \n15. I love open-ended conversations and although everyone hates TOK, it’s one of my favorite classes. \n16. I really like trying new things and was especially drawn to Harvard because of its expansive opportunities. I can’t wait to take classes that haven’t ever before been offered to me!\n17. Ironically, my ex boyfriend just got accepted into Yale. \n18. I was thinking of taking a GAP year but when I received my acceptance I realized there’s no way I can wait a whole year. \n19. The size of my senior class is about 100 people so it’s going to take a while for me to get used to the size of the freshmen class at Harvard.\n20. I can’t wait to meet all of you!!! If any of you travel to Paris, definitely let me know!","picture":"https://fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net/hprofile-ak-prn2/1086492_1062119277_1114506547_q.jpg"},{"from":{"name":"Caitlin Ner","id":"100000174287439"},"to":{"data":[{"name":"Timothy Kang","id":"100002420526832"},{"name":"Dahlia Eunice Kaki","id":"100006128530068"},{"name":"Harvard Class of 2018","id":"601401026562908"}]},"message":"Hey, I’m Caitlin! FINALLY, my Christmas shopping is done and I have some time to sit down and write a few things about myself. These 20 facts are long overdue, but better late than never:\n\n1. People must have thought I was weird because I started laughing and crying until I finally blurted out that I got accepted to Harvard. I did not tell anyone that the decision came that day and I checked my email after a workout with my track team. Ironically, my track coach is a former Yalie who ‘hates’ Harvard, but he still gave me a hearty congratulations. \n2. I speak Tagalog (although with a horrible accent) and I lived in the Philippines for 4 years of my life.\n3. I live in a little town called Eagle Rock in Los Angeles, CA. It is named after a rock that resembles an eagle. Yes, very literal. \n4. My last name is Ner. 3 letters, N-E-R. No, it’s not NerD. Haha.\n5. Beyoncé is queen. I went to her concert two times in one year.\n6. I’ve gone to a few other concerts this year – Justin Timberlake, LA Philharmonic, Chance the Rapper, Vampire Weekend, John Legend/Aerosmith/Stevie Wonder\n7. I ran into Pharrell during a jog at night while he was filming for a music video. He said and I quote “Y’all are sticking with school, that’s the shit. That’s wsup” \n8. I want to go skydiving and/or bungee jumping. \n9. I also want to learn how to snowboard or ski. I’ve never actually seen falling snow before.\n10.  Sometimes I feel like I would give up my left leg just to be good at singing. #isitonlyme #someonehelp \n11. My Asian cravings: Boba and all-you-can-eat KBBQ\n12. I’m going to France/Spain/England in a couple of months. Any favorite sights to see or things to do?\n13. I’m so excited that Timothy & Dahlia from my summer Jet Propulsion Laboratory internship were also accepted!\n14. My favorite time to play the piano is at night.\n15. Starbucks never spells my name correctly, but coffee has and probably will remain my best friend. \n16. Hikes and amazing views are the best.\n17. I love all things Disney: Disneyland, Disney movies, and even the Walt Disney Concert Hall.\n18. I still wonder how I will survive in the cold. Today was a sunny, 72-degree day.  \n19. Wait, hold on. I got accepted to my dream school... Is this real?\n20. I can’t wait to meet all of you interesting and talented people!

I wrote all my facts out on my phone to post on Saturday, but then my phone was stolen at a track meet so I'm starting from scratch today.\n2. I love running, as crazy as that may sound. I am very excited to run track and cross country at Harvard next year.\n3. The coolest run I've ever been on was across the Golden Gate Bridge.\n4. I'm an only child, but I've always wanted siblings so I can't wait to have roommates next year! \n5. My favorite book is A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith.\n6. When I was in elementary school I read every single Nancy Drew book.\n7. I love speaking French and all things French. I've been to France twice and I really want to go back, possibly through a study abroad program at Harvard.\n8. My mom grew up near Boston, so I have been to Boston lots of times and I have been a Red Sox fan as long as I can remember. I'm very excited to live in Cambridge for the next four years!\n9. My favorite food is strawberry shortcake.\n10. I've been interested in politics since I was little, largely because I live right outside of D.C. and my parents both work in politics.\n11. I usually prefer English and history to math and science, but I want to try taking chemistry or biology next year. I'm not sure yet what I want to concentrate in. \n12. I really want to learn how to surf and someday I want to go skydiving.\n13. I love fashion and reading Vogue magazine, although I know those are not the most academic of interests. \n14. I flew a prop plane last summer even though I don't have a pilot's license (or a driver's license, for that matter). \n15. I have one dog, a cockapoo (cocker spaniel and poodle mix). \n16. My favorite movie is Anger Management with Adam Sandler. \n17. When I'm older I want to travel a lot, especially to South America and the Middle East. \n18. I can do a headstand.\n19. I'm currently struggling with senioritis. Since I found out I got in to Harvard, it's been much harder to motivate myself to do my homework :)  \n20.

I currently live in Burlington, Vermont where we right now have about 8 inches of snow.\n\n2. The weather here is always wacky and unexpected.  The most common statement I have heard while living here is \"If you don't like the weather, wait 3 minutes, it will change!\" These past four days we have had a snow storm, freezing rain, sleet, and fog.\n\n3. I used to live right outside of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  I moved to Vermont the summer before my freshman year.\n\n4. Because of that I have been raised in a family of die-hard Flyers fans.\n\n5. I have a younger brother, who is in 9th grade, and sister, who is in 6th grade, so I am the oldest.\n\n6. No surprise, I am a natural born leader.\n\n7. I am also very friendly, positive, and outgoing.  I am always told that I never stop smiling.\n\n8. I love public speaking!  I love the rush of standing up in front of a crowd with my heart pounding.  I am always the go to girl when people need someone to step in for them with a speech or to keep a crowd entertained.\n\n9. I do not get embarrassed easily.  Last year, one of my friends told me to rap my speech for the student council race, so I did.  I thought it would be an epic fail but I got a standing ovation from all of the students.  Though the student council teacher was outraged, both the principal and many other teachers congratulated me for an exciting, and not boring, speech.  My mother teaches math at the school I go to, so she was very proud.\n\n10.  I go to a private Catholic school with yes priests.  We have a priest as the principal, and we have to wear uniforms.\n\n11. I am a Roman Catholic.  I go to church every Sunday.  However, I am not the kind of Catholic who tries to convert everyone and who does not accept people who are not Catholic.\n\n12.  Even though I am surrounded by Republicans, I am an Independent.\n\n13.  I pride myself on respecting other people's opinions.\n\n14. Sarcasm is a very important part of my life.  I love to joke around, and I am not easily offended.\n\n15. I am also very dramatic.\n\n16. My favorite TV shows are: Grey's Anatomy, How I Met Your Mother, Castle, and Private Practice.\n\n17. Eventually I would like to be a Cardiovascular Surgeon.  So I am going to be taking pre-med classes in college!\n\n18. I love trying new things.  Each year during high school I play a different winter sport.  Freshman year: Dance Team. Sophomore year: Snowboard Team. Junior year: Indoor Track. Senior Year: Basketball.  Fun Fact: I have never played on a JV team.\n\n19. I play rugby.  I started playing freshman year, after I went on a chorus trip with some girls who told me I would make a good jumper (a position in rugby).  They convinced me to play and when I came home I said \"Mom, I think I am going to play rugby.\" She said \"You know there's contact, like tackling, right?\" My parents made bets with each other about how long I would make it.  I did not know what rugby was and I was very scared for tackling, but I tried it out.  I hated it until later into the season.  I ended up loving it and becoming quite good.  This past year I went to England as a member of the U-20 National Team to play in the Nation's Cup Tournament against Canada, England, and South Africa.  I was the only high schooler.  Fun Fact: I am Harvard's first Varsity Rugby recruit.\n\n20.  Miracle is my favorite movie.  I have watched it every year at least once, because my family loves hockey.  I also watched it with my team in England, before we played England.  Coincidentally, we ended up beating England for the first time in the Nation's Cup in USA Rugby history.","picture":"https://fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net/hprofile-ak-prn2/t5/261074_100001310290889_1967653813_q.jpg"},{"from":{"name":"Irhad Sehovic","id":"100002319626775"},"to":{"data":[{"name":"Harvard Class of 2018","id":"601401026562908"}]},"message":"20 facts about me and my life :)\n\n1. My mother is from Bosnia and Herzegovina. My father is from Montenegro.\n2. I was born Munich, Germany. The Bosnian War caused my parents to flee to Deutschland, and they met each other there.\n3. Bosnians and Montenegrins speak Serbo-Croatian, or variations of it, so I’m fluent.\n4. In 2001 I moved to St. Louis, Missouri because a lot of Bosnians were moving here. St. Louis was one of the designated cities for refugees to move to after the war.\n5. I go to a high school with less than 600 students. Of those 600, 40% are Bosnian (I know, it’s crazy), so I speak Serbo-Croatian everyday with my friends.\n6. I took 3 years of German in high school, but I hope to take some more classes at Harvard and study abroad so that I can become fluent.\n7. I was homecoming king this year!!\n8. I’m the captain of my volleyball team, and volleyball is my second favorite sport.\n9. My first favorite, a European tradition, is soccer. :) \n10. This summer I got to spend three weeks at Murray State University and live the college life for almost a month. I learned a lot in those three weeks: I need to learn how to do my laundry. And another big problem was lack of sleep; college is too entertaining, especially at night. I got to get to bed early once I’m at Harvard!\n11. I’m the first Bosnian refugee from St. Louis to be admitted into Harvard, or so I’m told. So hopefully I’ll represent my people well.\n12. Haha I didn’t cry when I got accepted but my mom went crazy, I thought I had to take her to the hospital.\n13. My favorite subject is chemistry, but I don’t intend to major in any science field.\n14. I’m the president of my school’s DECA organization, and I made it to the International Career Development Conference for the first time last year! Any other DECA members here?\n15. DECA got me interested in business. I’m also interested in politics and law, so I have no idea what I want to do!\n16. I love playing soccer when I’m free. My friends and I go to the field down the street and play or we go into an indoor facility and have fun there.\n17. I love to work out, jog and stay fit. I love to work hard.\n18. The thing that I’m most excited about is meeting you guys and making connections. Anyone who graduates from Harvard will have a bright future, and you all are amazing people.\n19. A moment I will never forget is the night after I got accepted; I went to my school’s basketball game against our biggest rivals. The other school shouted some chant about one of their players, and my school started shouting “We got Harvard!” I got goose bumps, you cannot believe how happy I was at that moment.\n20. I’m excited for Visitas, and I can’t wait to meet you guys and some of the faculty in April. See you soon guys!","picture":"https://fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net/hprofile-ak-ash2/1117711_100002319626775_1861163627_q.jpg"},{"from":{"name":"Pavan Hegde","id":"768182569"},"to":{"data":[{"name":"Joe Kahn","id":"677692704"},{"name":"Harvard Class of 2018","id":"601401026562908"}]},"message":"I know im really late... but stupid IB has kept me from doing this...

I have been known to read the harry potter books back to front and in all orders\n\n5. I've debated for Hong Kong for the last 5 years and plan on debating in Harvard. Joe and I have been competing against each other for years! Will be nice to finally be on the same side bro :) \n\n6. I try to cook once in a while... but my skills are limited to frozen foods, pasta and (for anyone who knows), maggie noodles haha.\n\n7. I cannot wait for Sherlock. I have so many theories about how he survived and sat down and wrote them out. Anyone interested? Once I start watching a TV show, I must finish. I love the Newsroom, the West Wing, The Wire, House and Spartacus!!!!\n\n8. My favorite movie is \"the dark knight\" and I love Nolan's directing\n\n9. Harvard was always a dream of mine. Due to time differences, I received my acceptance at 4.30 am Hong Kong time, so I waited up by doing my Stanford app. As soon as I received the admit letter, I shouted so loud my neighbors woke up. I then burned my Stanford app (cause thats where it belongs am I right?)\n\n10. I love watching Indian movies and can often be found trying to 'dance' (i'm going to go ahead and call it that... others might say swaying or awkward). For those of you that know - Deepika Padukone is mine. \n\n11. I take advantage of the lax police system in India to take a shot at driving... and then got into a horrible motorcycle accident.. karma? \n\n12. One of my dreams is to backpack through Europe and earn money in each country by performing magic \n\n13. I am the only vegetarian in my school.. and I always end up eating the leaves\n\n14. As a child i covered myself with bubble wrap and rolled around the house making popping sounds\n\n15. I cried when Krispie Creme shut down in Hong Kong. Now when I visit the US, my first stop is Dunkin Donuts\n\n16. I have interned with Citibank and Credit Suisse. Citibank brought me out to boston last summer and thats the first time I got to see Harvard's campus - and fell in love\n\n17. I am SOOOO excited to meet all of you!!!

Don't want to be the odd one out, so here are 20 facts about me...\n\n1. I am Gemma and I am from the North West of England. I have always lived here so it will be great to have a change of scenery next autumn (or should I say fall!)\n2. I live with my Mum, two younger brothers and younger sister. I also have a Shih Tzu called Charlie. I love them all loads and I am going to miss them so much!\n3. I am a really boring person and am not musically or athletically talented, hence why I am so surprised that Harvard accepted me!\n4. When I found out I had been accepted by Harvard, I was doing some Christmas shopping at a big shopping centre (or mall!). I was absolutely overwhelmed by the news and me and my Mum were crying and jumping up and down. Safe to say we got a few funny looks from other shoppers! Note to self: Brits do not appreciate hysterical crying in public! ;)\n5. I know that the English education system is extremely different to the American system but for those of you who are familiar with it, I am currently studying A-Levels in English Literature, English Language, Maths, Modern History and Critical Thinking.\n6. I have a part-time job as a Crew Member at McDonald's and have worked there since last June.\n7. I have only been to America once before, and that was for a week-long Summer School visiting different American colleges/universities in August, so I can't wait to immerse myself in the American culture next year.\n8. Even though I am British, I do not like tea and unfortunately I do not know the Queen...although I am a big fan of the Royals!\n9.  I am really worried about what people will think of me at Harvard (especially my accent). I hope that I settle in well and that all of you Americans 'accept' me. \n10. I am considering concentrating in History as this is the course I have applied to study for my UK university choices, but I love the fact that I have the freedom to try out a range of other classes at Harvard and then decide at a later date.\n11. In the UK, I had to apply to five universities but if I hadn't been accepted by Harvard, I would be spending my Christmas holidays/break frantically working on Common App supplements for other American colleges as I LOVE the American education system so much more!\n12.  I am a chocoholic and will miss my favourite chocolates so much when I come to America. And probably British food in general to be honest.\n13. In contrast to my previous statement, I love food so much that I am scared that Harvard's unlimited meal plan and American food in general will mean I come home weighing as much as an elephant!\n14. I have always aspired to follow a career into teaching. But now I am not sure whether this is going to change and whether I want to come back to the UK after undergraduate study at Harvard or whether to stay in the US...depends how much I fall in love. ;)\n15. I am not much of a film buff but my friends have bought me a selection of American/Harvard-themed films for Christmas which I have been advised to watch. Titles include 'Legally Blonde' and 'The Social Network'. Please feel free to recommend some films/TV series to me...\n16. I would love to go travelling across America in the summer.\n17. I love reading and my favourite books are 'The Great Gatsby' and 'Animal Farm'. Although a book worm, I have never read the Harry Potter books as they never interested me when I was younger...perhaps I should give them a chance and start reading them some time soon.\n18. I am such a boring person that I am running out of interesting things to say now, especially after reading about all of the amazing things that all you talented people have got up to...\n19. I should be either wrapping Christmas presents right now or sleeping but this Facebook group is so much more exciting!\n20. I feel honoured to be part of Harvard's Class of 2018 and cannot wait to meet you all next year, and get to know many of you throughout my time in America!! I hope to make some friends for life...","picture":"https://fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net/hprofile-ak-ash1/273213_1653756058_285688173_q.jpg"},{"from":{"name":"James Baskerville","id":"100000631626351"},"to":{"data":[{"name":"Harvard Class of 2018","id":"601401026562908"}]},"message":"Sooooo I joined this group yesterday; apologies if these 20 facts are \"belated,\" but I wanted to contribute :) So yeah. \n\n1. I was checking my email in AP Physics when I saw the email. I immediately shouted across the room to my best friend, who got up, ran over, and tackled me to the ground. The teacher was pretty chill about it too.\n2. I had a choir concert that night, and my director grabbed my hand and announced to the whole crowd that I got accepted to Harvard. \n3. Choir and music are, collectively, my life. Well... I guess friends are cool too.\n4. I direct a student-run male a cappella group called Fine Tuning!\n5. I go to the Idyllwild Arts summer program for choir (it's an arts boarding school in SoCal).\n6. I don't always watch TV, but when I do it's The Big Bang Theory or The Sing Off.\n7. I went to a Chinese preschool and have studied for several years, but I'm still far from fluent.\n8. My mom is from Singapore and came here only with her brother when she was 18; my dad is from Iowa.\n9. Les Mis and Phantom are my favorite musicals.\n10. Eric Barnum is one of my favorite choral composers (Whitacre is overdone a little bit), and obviously Moses Hogan is bomb.\n11. I've lived my whole life in Belmont, California. It's a tiny city on the SF Peninsula in NorCal that no one's ever heard of. I just tell people San Francisco.\n12. Though I've never moved from Belmont, I've traveled to many countries, especially Asian ones (e.g. Singapore, Japan, Thailand, China).\n13. I love to play soccer, although I'm not amazing at it. I also do martial arts and run in track (the 400 is my race).\n14. I really enjoy using things like semicolons and dashes in social media.\n15. I've had a Harvard pennant hanging from my shelf for the longest time. My dad gave it to me when I was 8, and it's been my dream since then to go to Harvard.\n16. I still haven't realized that I'm going to my dream school. This is insane, guys. We got accepted to Harvard like whatttttt.\n17. None of my friends have been surprised that I got in. I'm not sure whether I'm supposed to take that as support or what.\n18. Ok, music artists. OneRepublic, Maroon 5, Fun, other random alternative artists. Guilty pleasure: Jesse McCartney. WAIT I CAN'T FORGET PENTATONIX OMG.\n19. My plan right now is to study computer science, but that isn't very set in stone. Definitely getting at least a certificate in music though!\n20. I can't wait to meet all of you!!

Here are my 20 facts in no particular order:\n\n1. I'm from Newton, Massachusetts, which is about 20 minutes away from Harvard.  I went to a big public school.\n2. I'm excited to run for Harvard track next year! I've been running distance on my high school track team since freshman year. I've often seen the Harvard distance runners run pretty much past house, but never thought I'd be one of them.\n3. I've been composing music since I was young, mostly for piano or ensembles. I'm hoping to take lots of the composition courses at Harvard, or at least be able to find a piano somewhere near my dorm.\n4. I'll probably concentrate in math or computer science, but I'm not 100% sure yet.\n5. I love singing but I'm terrible at it, as my teammates know too well.\n6. I play piano for my school's comedy improv group (for actors).\n7. Sleeping is probably one of my favorite things to do, but I don't do much of it because I can be a chronic procrastinator (Otherwise I probably would have posted my 20 facts earlier).\n8. I play a lot of ping-pong.\n9. I don't really watch TV besides Patriots football games. Occasionally I watch Friends, Family Guy, and the Big Bang Theory with my family.\n10. I’m an embarrassingly bad speller.\n11. Some of my favorite movies are Glory, The Social Network, Anchorman, and Oh Brother where art thou\n12. My family is not particularly religious, although we are technically Christian. If I were to become involved in practicing a religion, I would probably become a Buddhist.\n13. I can cook pasta, but that’s about it. Hopefully I will have time to learn how to cook better now that I’m done applying. \n14. I’m not the outdoorsy type, except when I’m on long runs. Then I love to go exploring through woods and parks, especially with my teammates.\n15. My favorite composers are Erik Satie, Beethoven, and Samuel Barber. \n16. My favorite books are The Kite Runner, Oliver Twist (the ones I said for my interview), and then Harry Potter and anything by Roald Dahl.\n17. I play jazz piano for events from time to time, sometimes with classmates and sometimes on my own. \n18. I despise the common app web site. I’m so glad to be done with it!\n19. I love making up games when I’m on long runs with my team to keep us from getting bored. They often involve naming things in categories, catching leaves, or sprinting back and having to catch up when you lose.\n20. I go on Facebook way too much. Also the Onion. \n\nLooking forward to meeting all of you!","picture":"https://fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net/hprofile-ak-prn2/1117774_100000144373685_1565487165_q.jpg"},{"from":{"name":"Marcus Granderson","id":"100001532212241"},"to":{"data":[{"name":"Harvard Class of 2018","id":"601401026562908"}]},"message":"Hello!

I go to P-CEP or Plymouth Canton Educational Park, which is one campus that houses three high schools, Plymouth, Canton and Salem High School. My home school is Plymouth but students have classes in all three high schools, which means we have to walk between classes in sunshine, rain, sleet, snow, and thunder! \n3. I am actually still 16 years old even though I'm a Senior. I won't be 17 until January 3 \n4.When I was younger, like 3 years old, I used to act like I was giving sermons or speeches to my family. I love public speaking so I guess I fell in love with it at a early age. \n5.I LOVE the Christmas Season. I would live in a state of perpetual Christmas if I could. I love the true meaning of it, the family, the food, the lights, the atmosphere. Everything about it! \n6.I have been kissed by a monkey before. I was in Thailand and I don't know what possessed me to take a picture with chimpanzee, but I did, and he kissed me ON THE CHEEK!\n7. I LOVE to cook. Real men cook! I love to prepare different types of food, but my favorite is Italian! It is my dream to go to Italy\n8. I love Gospel music, as well as some older R &B, Classical and Pop Music.\n9. I love following current and political events. I love the inter-workings of politics and government, but hate the corruption and dishonesty in it. \n10. I love historical/ political movies like Lincoln and The Iron Lady.\n11. I absolutely love the movie Ratatouille! I’ve seen it so many times I know every line by heart! \n12. I actually never wanted to go to Harvard before the college tour I did over the summer. It is amazing what one tour can do. \n13. I love New York City! It is my favorite city on the planet and I have only been there twice.\n14. I would love to be motivational speaker/ inspirational book writer.\n15. I’m a romantic at heart\n16. I have played the alto, tenor, and baritone saxophone.  \n17. My favorite seafood dish would have to be shrimp scampi\n18. I have never had a Twinkie. I am a little embarrassed to say that but hopefully I can change that soon\n19. I’m currently in a class in which we run a full functioning, certified restaurant out of our high school called The Rock Café. I was on the fryer station last week! \n20.

I always thought that I would cry/bawl/scream if I got accepted. Instead, I was so much in shock that I was numb and emotionless for an hour. \n2. I consider sunny California my hometown but was born in Austin, Texas and lived in Minnesota for a while. \n3. Cranberry juice is delicious. \n4. I am obsessed with anything Sherlock Holmes related! I have read all the stories and BBC Sherlock is the best. \n5. I have been on the XC team for four years but am considering joining ultimate Frisbee in college!\n6. My favorite shows include Numb3rs, Shark Tank, Big Bang Theory, Food Network programs, and Sherlock (of course!)\n7. Syntax! --(;””) <3\n8. I discovered a protein. \n9. There is a giant Costco teddy bear in my room. \n10. A Harvard sweater has been hanging in the back of my closet for three years. Before last week, I stayed as far away from it as possible.\n11. Seriously considering buying red felt and white paint to make DIY pennants. \n12. Nearly asphyxiated from the smell of Sharpies while making Christmas cards.\n13. I love my kindle! I named it Paige because books have pages. (I thought I was clever then. haha)\n14. Honorary Ravenclaw according to Pottermore.\n15. One of my closest friends goes to Yale. I send her all the memes posted on this page. :D\n16. Beyond knowing that I am a math/science person, I have no idea what I want to major in. My interests include chemistry/environmental/economics/physics.\n17. My musical interests include OneRepublic, Bastille, and the Neighborhood. On the other hand, my best friend likes heavy metal….\n18. My favorite ice cream flavor is mint chocolate chip. \n19. I am a night owl!

But if it was, you'd surely find me there.\n6) I love music.\n7) I am in the marching band and did not want to be drum major (captain) because I wouldn't get to play my instruments.\n8.) I don't like how placing an eight before \")\" creates 8)\n9) My favorite songs are \"You Were on the Cross\" by Matt Maher and \"Titanium\" by David Guetta featuring Sia.\n10) I went to Spain for World Youth Day in 2011. If you are ever in Madrid, go to Walk to Wok.\n11) This past summer, I went down to Tiger, Georgia for \"church camp\" and it was wicked fun. Yes, I use the word \"wicked\".\n12) I wish I could draw well, but I can't, so I think I will work on that...\n13) One day, I want to write film scores.\n14) I love food, specifically comfort foods, and more specifically Lipton \"Noodle Soup\".\n15) I will randomly start singing multiple times while at Harvard.\n16) Downton Abbey is the best TV series ever, but I haven't seen season 3 yet so no spoiler! I also am a huge fan of Survivor, Grey's Anatomy, and Tangled (yes, the Disney movie).\n17) Pokemon was my childhood, and it was ruined when in generation five, they created an ice cream Pokemon. That is and never will be okay. I still love the video games though.\n18) I want to someday learn how to speak Spanish and Arabic.\n19) Procrastination should be an Olympic sport because I really want a shiny gold medal.\n20) If it is going to snow, it should either snow so little that I don't have to shovel or so much that school is canceled.

I'll try to keep it brief.\n\n1. I couldn't talk for about 15 minutes after opening my acceptance. It's still a little unreal...\n2. I live in a mountain-locked faux-Bavarian tourist town in Washington State called Leavenworth. (In case you were wondering, the Federal Penitentiary of the same name is in KS)\n3. I don't think I've ever taken my car radio off the local NPR station. I met David Sedaris last month and practically died.\n4. I take pride in my athletic mediocrity. Running is my favorite sport because it takes no coordination. \n5. My favorite assignments in school are presentations. I've been known to spend hours watching TED Talks.\n6. I'm a brilliant chef, especially when it comes to ice and frozen pizza.\n7. I love performing. I've spent time dancing, singing, and acting over the years, often at the same time. Lately I've been focused on singing.\n8. I dedicate a ton of time to my choir. I'm a baritone. I can't wait to keep singing at Harvard!\n9. I love my voice teacher. \n10. I was born in Madison, WI., and am definitely a midwesterner at heart.\n11. After a trip in 2012, I realized that I adore Northern Europe. I'm thinking about spending a semester abroad in Denmark or Sweden.\n12. I love theater. There is such a rush involved in performing or watching a good show. The Book of Mormon, Company, Wicked and West Side Story are a few of my favorite shows.\n13. I've watched C-SPAN by choice. Repeatedly.\n14. Instant Netflix is my vice of choice. \n15. My favorite TV shows include Top Gear, The West Wing, The Good Wife, Revenge (guilty pleasure), House of Cards, Mad Men, Girls and Orange is the New Black.\n16. I could talk all day about any of the shows on that list.\n17. I can't wait to live in the Northeast; I like everything about it.\n18. I love trivia games. \n19. Mary Poppins is my comfort movie and all-time favorite Disney film.\n20. I don't know how I can possibly wait 8 more months to start the most amazing journey of my life with all of you.

I live in Acton, Massachusetts. I go to our public school and my class has over 500 students. \n\n2. I've run track and cross country all four years of high school. I run the 2 mile (just got back from a 2 mile race!) predominantly in track, but also the mile. I love all sports and I used to play football and basketball pretty competitively.\n\n3. I'm planning on concentrating in government and possibly economics, too. I worked in Senator Kerry's office and on the Elizabeth Warren campaign and those experiences helped me realize politics are what I want to go into.\n\n4. I don't like food that much. Going to restaurants doesn't excite me, so I feel bad whenever someone takes me out for my birthday or something. I love grape juice and would prefer a carton of that to cake any day.\n\n5. When I was younger I loved pandas and as a result my basement has about 25 stuffed animal pandas. \n\n6. My favorite movies include Inception, the Batman movies, Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Remember the Titans, and pretty much any great sports movie. I also like chick flicks, Dear John always gets me. Those weekend marathons, especially Harry Potter, always distract me.\n\n7. My favorite TV shows are Psych, NCIS, Criminal Minds, Shark Tank, and Storage Wars (even though it's so fake.) During the school year, though, I almost only watch sports.\n\n8. Speaking of which, I'm a die-hard Red Sox, Celtics, Bruins, and Pats fan. I also am a March Madness fanatic.\n\n9. I'm really not afraid to put myself out there. My sophomore year I entered our first annual male beauty pageant, Mr. AB, and sang as my talent even though I have absolutely no musical talent. I entered it again this year and I'm singing \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough.\"\n\n10. My favorite musical artists are John Mayer, Taylor Swift, Kanye West, Hunter Hayes, Lupe Fiasco, B.o.B,  and Childish Gambino. I listen to pretty much anything, except classical music.\n\n11. I went to John Mayer and Taylor Swift concerts the past summer. A friend's parents owns a company which sponsors Taylor so we got amazing seats and pit passes. I had a sign asking her to prom, but sadly she never called me.\n\n12. I'm a really open person and (I hope) very easy to talk . I have a pretty diverse group of friends and I've made friends with someone on almost every team I compete against. I'm pretty sarcastic with my friends, but I'm also a good listener when I should be.\n\n13. I like ties and sweaters. We generally wear shirt and ties to school the days of our big meets, and I love doing that.\n\n14. I want to study abroad in Europe. I want to hit up all the huge European cities like London, Paris, and Berlin sometime in my life.\n\n15. I get really sad when I think that 90's (and some 2000's) television is fading. Recess, Drake and Josh, Scooby Doo, etc. were the best shows ever.\n\n16. I have great relationships with my teachers, I love talking to them about things not necessarily relating to school. I come into school every morning and chill with my junior year English teacher and sometimes go on runs with a couple of my teachers. I hope professors next year are as open! \n\n17. I can't be President because I was born in India, so my life goal is to become a Senator! \n\n18. I've never given myself much time to join clubs in high school because I had cross country or track every day after school, but at Harvard I really want to try new things like model UN, writing for the Crimson, and/or debate! \n\n19. At 3:00 PM the day we got the decisions I texted my mom and my brother and told them I had been deferred because I assumed I would be. I got the actual decision at 3:30 outside running 400s at track (yes, I brought my phone), and couldn't have been more shocked. I found out on my birthday and couldn't have dreamed of a better birthday!\n\n20. Harvard has always been my dream school. The academics are obviously incredible and the location couldn't be better for me. I love being near Boston and also only 30 minutes from home. I also have a lot of friends going to school in Boston or at Tufts, so it's all the better! I never though Harvard would be possible! I can't wait to meet so many driven and successful people, it's truly humbling!","picture":"https://fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net/hprofile-ak-ash2/1085716_598027308_1482726820_q.jpg"},{"from":{"name":"Eric Abreu","id":"100002253437754"},"to":{"data":[{"name":"Harvard Class of 2018","id":"601401026562908"}]},"message":"I should have done my 20 facts a long time ago, but I wanted to do them after the finals. I’ve been spending a lot of time reading the posts in our group and feared that I would spend even more after writing my 20 facts. Anyway…\n1. I was born in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil, but moved to Los Angeles, California two and a half years ago when my mom married someone who lives here.\n2. I didn't know any English when I came to the United States two and a half years ago.\n3. When I first read the email from Harvard saying that I was accepted, I thought it was a prank, so I only told my friends I had been accepted only after doing some research to confirm it was not a prank.\n4. I am the first student in my school to be accepted to an Ivy League school.\n5. I listen to almost any kind of music -- from classical to heavy metal. If I had to choose a favorite band, I would probably pick Linkin Park.\n6. I like reading. Especially if there is a movie, TV show, or videogame based on the book. Most of the times I start reading a book and think, \"I'll read it and watch the movie/play the game later,\" but rarely do it since I already know everything that will happen. \n7. The books I read recently and enjoyed the most are The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo trilogy and Ender's Game. I have not seen the movies, though. I don't plan on watching The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, but I'm curious about Ender's Game. I was going to watch it when it came out, but I was busy.\n8. I play videogames whenever I have some free time, which rarely occurs. My favorite videogames are Alan Wake, Portal 2, and Assassin's Creed 2. The games I'm currently playing are Tera, Batman Arkham City, and Need for Speed World.\n9. I love watching TV shows. My favorite TV shows are Breaking Bad, Chuck, Prison Break, Friends, How I Met Your Mother, The Big Bang Theory, and Arrow. \n10. I used to play volleyball in Brazil -- the last time I played was about five years ago. Some people want me to join the school's volleyball team, but I still don't know if I should -- sports are not really my thing.\n11. I love going for long walks.\n12. I dislike the Californian weather. It's almost always sunny and rarely rains. I like the cold, but I don't know how well I'll handle the winters at Harvard.\n13. I like to finish everything I start. This is one of the main reasons why I do reasonably well at school; I can't even fall asleep until I'm done with all of my homework and any additional thing I have to do.\n14. I'm a Jehovah's Witness.\n15. I work as a laboratory assistant at the University of Southern California, and plan on doing something similar at Harvard.\n16. I bought a Kindle Fire HD 7 last year and I honestly don't know why I liked it so much. Since I don't have a cellphone, this is what got me into Facebook and texting. I disliked Amazon's version of Android 4.0.2, so I installed a custom ROM -- CyanogenMod 11 -- and I'm currently using Android 4.4, which is nothing like what I was forced to use before. I bricked my kindle the first time I installed the custom ROM for the first time a few months ago, though (I forgot to check a box... what apparently was a very important box). But I fixed it using a factory cable.\n17. I don't like sleeping, but whenever I don't get enough sleep, my sight gets blurry and I can't speak coherently.\n18. I usually listen to classical music when doing my homework.\n19. I'm terrible at sarcasm -- so terrible that people have raised The Big Bang Theory's sarcasm sign for me a few times.\n20. I can't wait to meet all of you at VISITAS!","picture":"https://fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net/hprofile-ak-prn2/274601_100002253437754_165016717_q.jpg"},{"from":{"name":"Gaby Anechka Tunik Germanos","id":"100001638916297"},"to":{"data":[{"name":"Harvard Class of 2018","id":"601401026562908"}]},"message":"Just curious to see how \"old\" we all are :)\nI'm 31...ouch...","link":"http://www.mbti123.com/mental/en/","name":"Mental Age Test","caption":"www.mbti123.com","description":"Mental Age Test","icon":"https://fbstatic-a.akamaihd.net/rsrc.php/v2/yD/r/aS8ecmYRys0.gif","picture":"https://fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net/hprofile-ak-prn2/1117875_100001638916297_1910087405_q.jpg"},{"from":{"name":"Courtney Smith","id":"100000780652086"},"to":{"data":[{"name":"Harvard Class of 2018","id":"601401026562908"}]},"message":"Since I've had a ton of school work the past week, I kind of cheated on the 20 facts thing and wrote like a sentence about myself but I decided to do the full 20 facts so here goes nothing:\n\n1.

I live in Pennsylvania, around 45 minutes outside Philly.\n\n3.  I can name every US presidents' last name in one breath (I learned it in second grade for extra credit and for some reason I've never forgotten them)\n\n4.  I have a dog named Blitzen because he was born on Christmas. \n\n5.  I haven't eaten anything dessert or junk food since summer after sophomore year\n\n6.  In first grade my dream job was to be a paleontologist because it sounded like a cool job and I liked the word. \n\n7.  One day I'd love to qualify for the Olympic Trials for Track.\n\n8.

I have had a severe peanut allergy my whole life.  I thought I had a nut allergy as well up until a few months ago, but now I eat pistachios a couple times a week!\n\n10.  I have eaten in over half of the (I think it's around twelve) dinning halls at Harvard in the last year and love the idea of an unlimited meal plan since I eat so much food!\n\n11.  One time I went to an anatomy class at Harvard on my official and I was already late for the class so I tried to quietly sneak into the back and I tripped over someone's computer cord and unplugged their computer.\n\n12.  For some reason, I've never gotten my ears pierced, but now I kind of like that and don't think I ever will.\n\n13.  One of my best friends (the one in my profile picture) is going to University of Pennsylvania next year and although we are both in the same English class and she told our teacher where she was going to school, he said \"No way!  I've never taught an Ivy League student before!\" when I told him where I'm going (he only taught lower level classes at my school before this year)\n\n14.  Two weeks ago Nike flew my team and I out to Oregon for Cross Country Nationals and I got to meet people from all over the country and missed a week of school thanks to snow delays.\n\n15.  I have a great grandmother who is 102 years old, but still healthy and sharp!\n\n16.  I'm not really a big TV watcher but when I do I usually enjoy watching an episode of Psych or Shark Tank.\n\n17.  Although I'm not pursuing anything astronomy-related in college, I love learning about space. The more I learn about it the less I know if that makes sense.  If any of you could explain the fundamentals of the string theory to me that'd be great.\n\n18.  My favorite movies are the Blind Side, Catching Fire, Despicable Me, and How to Train Your Dragon.\n\n19.  I can't wait to be a part of the Crimson Cross Country and Track teams next year!\n\n20.  I'm so excited for next year to attend Harvard and meet all you amazing people! I've already watched the Harvard Tours Yale video like ten times.","picture":"https://scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hprofile-prn2/1116451_100000780652086_1733423403_q.jpg"},{"from":{"name":"Jazmine Phillips-Acie","id":"1624970688"},"to":{"data":[{"name":"Harvard Class of 2018","id":"601401026562908"}]},"message":"This group has introduced me to the most incredible, intelligent, and talented young people, and I congratulate all of you! Here goes my 20 facts! \n\n1. I am from Pittsburgh, PA,  the \"City of Champs!\"  Here we go Steelers, Pirates, Pens!   We don't have a basketball team so I root for the Miami Heat (followed Lebron even back in Cleveland) \n2. I have been dancing since the age of 3. I am a competitive dancer which has allowed me to travel to perform and study all styles. I'm also on my school's dance team. I want to try out for the Crimson Dance Team!!! \n3. I go to a suburban/rural high school in my neighborhood called Plum. Oddly enough I have yet to find any plums growing around here. From 6th-9th grade I studied literary arts and dance at a performing arts school downtown. Consequently, I feel exposed to a wide range of people and love them all󾌵 \n4. I feel like everyone in my family is involved in education. My choice to concentrate in economics and then pursue law is still very much supported though. \n5. I can't wait to write for the Crimson! Having majored in literary arts and being editor for my school paper writing for the Crimson would be amazing!\n6. My friends and even my teachers call me Jazzy Fre$h because of a froyo place Razzy Fresh. \n7. I am a generally jovial, fun-loving person. If I'm on a roll solving a Calc BC problem I start dancing literally pirouetting and tapping right at the board. I LOVE math! Does anyone else feel elation when everything just falls into place and the answers hit like lightning? \n8. Seeing someone sitting alone amongst a sea of cliques breaks my heart. If I see a student alone in the cafeteria I rush over to ask them to sit with my friends and I. \n9. I love books, TV, movies, and theater! I enjoy Jane Austen, Maya Angelou, the Hunger Games, the Bronte sisters, and most vampire fiction (don't judge). I'm a book worm, but aren't most of us. I LOVE Scandal, The Vampire Diaries, So You Think You Can Dance, and Glee. Mean Girls is a classic to me and I WILL quote it. I love action movies though especially if there's a strong female character (that carries over to literature for sure). Concerning musicals, I love Billy Elliot, The Wiz, Sweet Charity, Chicago, In The Heights, and The Lion King.\n10. I am probably coming off as a very girly individual, but as a child I had a Yu-Gi-Oh deck and close to a hundred video games especially of the Pokemon variety. I've also played Powderpuff football\n at my school. We donate the profits to local charities.\n11. I've been dreaming about Harvard my whole life. I CAN'T stop smiling. \n12. I am completely fascinated by people. I will never run out of questions to ask them (or questions in general). That explains my love for interviewing people. \n13. I've never traveled beyond the continent and look forward to using the study abroad opportunities. \n14. I love all genres of music, but I love dubstep, hip-hop, and pop the most.\n15. I'm very interested in government and politics. I love to debate. I'm Student Council Treasurer.\n16. I honestly enjoy watching the news. I could leave CNN on all day.\n17. I enjoy breaking stereotypes in all ways. I think it's truly awesome when people can't label you or define you because you don't fit any one mold.\n18. I love to help people. From tutoring, organizing car washes for Make-A-Wish (my school's their largest contributor), and spending my summer in the soup kitchen/food pantry, I find it very fulfilling. \n19. I study best with music playing. Yes, I do end up dancing. I promise not to wake my pod mates. I'll wear headphones!\n20. I adore my 9 year old sister. People call her my \"mini-me,\" and strangers can look at her and know she's my sister. My family's very important to me. \n\nAll I can hope for is to inspire others to achieve their dreams despite all odds. \nI can't wait to meet everyone at VISITAS!","picture":"https://fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net/hprofile-ak-ash1/275065_1624970688_1621270526_q.jpg"},{"from":{"name":"Jullian Duran","id":"100000106094071"},"to":{"data":[{"name":"Harvard Class of 2018","id":"601401026562908"}]},"message":"Better late than never, here are 20 facts about me:\n1.

Decided late was better than never (plus I still have a head start on all the regular decision peeps). You guys all seem like awesome, down-to-earth people--I can't wait to meet you all! Anyways, here's my list:\n\n1. I'm a VA native but go to school and spend most of my life in DC\n\n2. Microwave-brownies are my favorite midnight snack (Am I subconsciously preparing myself for college life already? I'll let you decide)\n\n3. I am making this list instead of writing an AP comparative politics paper...representative of my day-to-day struggle ever since Friday to start my homework pre-10pm \n\n4. I wrestle and am captain of my school's co-ed wrestling team (though it's not really coed as I'm the only girl in our wrestling conference...do i count as \"one of the boys\"? who knows...)\n\n5. I absolutely love hiking, kayaking, and all that is outdoors--I can't wait to go on weekend camping trips/ join the outdoors activities club (hopefully with some of you guys)! \n\n6. I love Ethiopian food. But in general, I'm a foodie and am always down for a food adventure (though I'm not nearly as daring as Andrew Zimmern)\n\n7. I'm atrocious at piano but still love plunking around on the piano keys with my little brother\n\n8. I have a little brother and a big brother, both of whom I love dearly\n\n9. I run XC and track in my highschool and though I'm not going to get involved in H's D1 athletics, I hope I'll get to run with some of you guys around Harvard's beautiful campus\n\n10. I have no idea what I want to major in (shhh don't tell Harvard admissions.... I pledged to my love of chem)\n\n11. That being said, I really like chemistry as well as applied mathematics  (ethnomathmatics especially!)\n\n12. Vonnegut is the best. Can't get enough of his goofy characters, awesome leitmotifs, and dark satire\n\n13. Im an avid Ted talk watcher... I can't get enough of 'em\n\n14. Buzzfeed is my downfall. Once I click one list, I will not get any more homework done for at least an hour\n\n15. I make a lot of lists to stay organized (color coordination ftw) so I'm loving this group activity!\n\n16. At one point, my family had 9 pets: bees (i'm counting them as one...let the hive live on!), a rabbit, a dog (a chesapeake bay retriever--she's the best!), a caique, three cockatiels, a rainbow finch, and my little brother.\n\n17. I'm happy listening to all music (as long as it isn't death metal) \n\n18. I'm a huge breakfast person--Belgian waffles, lemon souffle pancakes, strawberry crepes galore!\n\n19. I may or may not have accidentally catapulted my phone ten feet in the air when I heard it buzz and saw that \"Harvard College Admissions\" was the subject line \n\n20. I FLIPPED THE HELL OUT when I saw congratulations on the first line of the email. I'm still floating on a cloud and can't really contain my excitement.

Thanks for reading :))\n1. It's been a whole week and still it's barely sunk in that I'm in! I was so afraid to open my Harvard email that I waited a full hour after mail went out before checking. When I finally plucked up the courage and opened the email, my mom burst into tears and I started spewing happy gibberish to my sister as we happy danced. Luckiest Friday the 13th ever. Good times. :)\n2. I'm hailing from Brookline High School in Brookline, Mass.\n3. I'm the son of immigrant parents, which can be a blessing or a curse.\n4. My sister and only sibling is older than I am by two years and goes to Boston University. We used to be mistaken for twins, until I got significantly darker and taller (and handsomer?????) than her.\n5. I am a minute late to everything. If you live in Brookline and you've ever seen me sprinting across the street at 8:10, it's because I'm late for school and I don't get a ride, ever.\n7. I am pathetically unathletic but joined spring track freshman year because all of my friends did winter. I should have realized that most of said friends didn't return for spring… I didn't enjoy it, but my coach convinced me to return for cross country, which was better. I'm still a pretty lousy runner, but hey.\n8. My academic passion is in the sciences. I've worked in biology labs at Northeastern University and at Brigham and Women's Hospital these past two summers.\n9. I haven't read Harry Potter in a while, but I really liked the series. Interestingly, I liked the first two books the most because they were the least dark and scary. Maybe that'll change if I ever pick the books up again.\n10. One of my dreams is learn to play piano. I've been in a chorus for two and a half years, but other than that, I've had no musical training or lessons whatsoever. I've been trying to teach myself to play piano from a book, but it hasn't been going too well. I can't afford a teacher or a proper piano, at least not yet, so if there's anyone out there who would be willing to teach me cheaply/for free I will love you forever thank you in advance muahhh. <333\n11. Other skills that I've never had the opportunity to learn that I'd like to: to swim, to whistle, to ride a bike, to play guitar, to snowboard, to ski, to rollerblade, to ice skate. And maybe to overcome that fear of roller coasters.\n12. In other news about my fears, I have terrible stage fright and I've never performed something (a song, a poem, a speech anything!) publicly without messing up. Is there still hope for my inner drama ambitions at Harvard?? \n13. I talk way too much with my hands. I'm terrified of being uninteresting. I think I'm still in my awkward phase.\n14. My favorite number is 9, but I'm also partial to 4 because of Beyonce. ugh, she is perf.\n15. The majority of my wardrobe consists of free T-shirts and, since I'm one of the youngest in my extended family, hand-me-downs. Most of my clothes are either too big or too small but I recently got a set of old stuff and it seems someone older in the family is finally the same size as me!! Pants that fit are the best things in the world. Gahh. Still don't have enough sweaters though.\n16. Many of my friends would tell you that I'm always smiling. While that's not true, I do smile a lot and I laugh at some pretty dumb things. My maturity level generally fluctuates between that of a four-year-old and that of an eighth grader. I love puns.\n17. I struggle with staying motivated with long books and I actually rather enjoyed Pride and Prejudice, but I couldn't stop falling asleep while reading it. Ditto for Wuthering Heights, although I didn't enjoy that as much. My favorite book so far is The Great Gatsby, but I don't consider myself well-read at all, so that will probably change. Book suggestions?? \n18. I can't make a decision for my life. Like, not even what to get for lunch at the caf. Or choosing an outfit for school. Agh.\n19. I love eating and cooking shows and chocolate and peanut butter and will do anything for free food. ugh getting a snack brb.\n20. I do my best work at night, but my best friend is a natural early riser and I'm soo jealous.\nI can't wait to meet y'all! I could spend all day reading the stuff you post. Talk to ya soon.","picture":"https://fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net/hprofile-ak-prn1/174452_100003952846102_1988981160_q.jpg"},{"from":{"name":"William Oh","id":"100005375525943"},"to":{"data":[{"name":"Harvard Class of 2018","id":"601401026562908"}]},"message":"Finals are finally over, it's raining in California (huzzah!) or at least where I live, and I just ate hot ramen. Never a better time to post my facts after procrastinating for a week. \n\n1. I am from Santa Clarita, CA about 30 minutes above Los Angeles. Or because no one knows where that is, Six Flags California. \n2. I can't ride rollercoasters, go figure. \n3. I am an environmentalist, but I take 15 minute long hot showers (The environmentalist within me cries every time). BUT HOT SHOWERS ARE GLORIOUS. I am thankful every day that I was born in the first world.  \n4. I LOVE Congress, just the legislative branch in general. I have my own personal copy of Robert's Rules of Order 11th Edition. Politics and government = my passion. I used to watch C-SPAN for fun and watched archived sessions of the British Parliament and Indian Congress. On top of that, when I met my Congressman for the first time (in 9th grade) at a gas station, I couldn't approach him for like 10 minutes. I have a gavel and Congressional bell on my desk. I do Student Congress. Yeah, I am that weird. Can we still be friends? LOL\n5. My dream is to serve in the Senate one day. I love service.     \n6. I love Student Government and I hope to get involved with the Harvard Undergraduate Council. Look at that! I am so proud of the politician within me already campaigning lol. \n7. I love reading so much. Books = life. Yet, unlike many of you who are reading Russian literature, I still read... Percy Jackson and the Olympians. Don't judge me guys.  \n8. I love watching movies. They are ughing perfect. And TV Shows. Legend of Korra anyone? No? Ok. I'll just go then. \n9. Disney = AWESOMENESS. Enough said. By the way, go watch Frozen. :) \n10. I will literally eat a tub of ice cream in one sitting if it is Mint Chip. Not even kidding. \n11. Kit-Kats and Hershey Kisses are glorious. \n12. I characterize myself as an optimistic person and I pride myself on being a kind person. :)\n13. These facts are getting really random, but whatever #beingarebel. \n14. Inspirational quotes are the bomb. My favorite, \"Never doubt that a few caring people can't change the world, because indeed, that's all who ever have.\" ~Margaret Mead\n15.  When I don't get enough sleep, I suddenly lose the ability to speak coherently. Which is like every day. But I promise you, I am a good speaker lol.\n16. I tend to talk a lot, I realized. \n17. The first time I consumed caffeine in a substantial amount (meaning more than a sip) was last year... First time I drank Coca-Cola and coffee. No shame in me, is there? \n18. I cannot believe that I got into Harvard. So humbled and shocked, and it is literally a dream come true. I thought the email was a really bad joke. \n19. You guys are all seriously so awesome and I cannot wait to meet all of you. And the realization that these facts are REALLY long and that you have just wasted 5 minutes of your life. Well, nice to meet you! :D","picture":"https://fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net/hprofile-ak-ash2/1119127_100005375525943_40452246_q.jpg"},{"from":{"name":"Annie Schugart","id":"100001665162875"},"to":{"data":[{"name":"Harvard Class of 2018","id":"601401026562908"}]},"message":"Better late than never... (maybe). Here are my 20 facts! \n\n1. I'm from Kansas (and, while this may be shocking, I don't live on a farm) and am supposedly the first person in my school's 25-year history to be accepted to Harvard! Like all of you, being accepted was one of the best moments of my life.\n\n2. I've loved Harvard my whole life, but fell in love this summer when I attended their journalism program (you can see my work on The Harvard Crimson's website!). Any fellow journalists out there who dream of writing for The Harvard Crimson?\n\n3. I feel like the most average person compared to you all!\n\n4. I keep having dreams about Harvard and being back at The Harvard Crimson building.\n\n5. My brother attends the University of Kansas, and my family wants me to go there too, so who knows if I'll actually end up at Harvard... although it's my dream school! I can't imagine myself anywhere else.\n\n6. I have an unhealthy obsession with tie-dye. WILL SOMEONE HAVE A TIE-DYE GATHERING WITH ME IN HARVARD YARD? Like every week in the fall and spring! Wait. This is proof that I am officially reserving the right to create the Tie-Dye Society of Harvard (it probably already exists, honestly)! This is legitimately going to happen.\n\n7. I am a germophobe.\n\n8. You can pretty easily stalk my life with a simple Google search because I love writing! I've been published in USA Today's education section and Huffington Post's teen section.\n\n9. It was basically a premonition when the recommendation on google search of my name was \"Annie Schugart Harvard\" (No, I don't google myself... someone got bored in my econ class), and I actually died when I saw that a few months ago. I so badly wanted to get into Harvard that it was probably unhealthy.\n\n10. I play the flute and love it. I hope to join some sort of band at Harvard. I'm excited that I'm off to Texas next week for an All-American band (any other All-Americans here?), but something tells me that Massachusetts is where I belong :)\n\n11. Penguins are my favorite animal for no reason whatsoever.\n\n12. I love dance and am on my school's dance team. It'd be so fun to be on the Harvard dance team. Anyone plan on trying out?\n\n13. I feel like I belong at Harvard, ya know? It's pretty discouraging right now because it feels as if all odds are against me to go to Harvard, but I know I'm going to be unhappy wherever else I'll end up. Harvard Yard is calling my name. I feel so at peace within those beautiful gates :)\n\n14. I have peculiar study habits. \n\n15. I'm excessively paranoid about random things, such as eating yogurt out of plastic containers (scraping that plastic container surely is releasing toxins into the food), having a laptop on my lap (all that radiation emitting into my legs), touching anything aluminum in fear that it will enter my bloodstream and cause brain deterioration... okay yeah I'll stop now.\n\n16. One time my parents punished me by not allowing me to go to the library. Gotta love 'em for handling a nerd like me and doing it everyday with a smile :)\n\n17. I just love people and I love helping people and I just want everyone to be happy and I want everyone to be loved and I just want to spend each day interacting with people because I love true connections and deep conversations and ironically hate run-on sentences.\n\n18. I like artsy people, and I like to pretend I'm artsy.\n\n19. People at my school think I'm crazy (hopefully in a good way) because I \"never sleep\" and am \"always at school\" (can't wait to unite with fellow members of this unique breed). I am in love with my school though. I mean seriously, our motto is \"Amor Vincit Omnia\" which means \"Love Conquers All...\" LIKE HOW COOL IS THAT?\n\n20. I still feel like any moment I'll wake up from this beautiful dream, in which I would probably start crying and never be able to live. And sometimes I really, really wish I were in Cambridge right NOW.\n\nI've enjoyed reading about all of you!

I have technically gone to the same school for 12 years, but it has had three different names during my time here (TNHS, NHP, UNHP). \n\n2. I have been taking French for those 12 years and can now speak it better than my first language, Malayalam. I even wrote my Extended Essay in it.\n\n3. My birthday is March 12, and I will be turning 18 in Paris on my Senior Trip! Can't wait.\n\n4. My school is so small (123 seniors) that it LITERALLY only took five minutes for everyone to know I got into Harvard. \n\n5.

You can find me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram at any time of the day. \n\n14. Recently the DFW metroplex froze over and we missed school. I spent one day watching the entire second season of Breaking Bad (my new favorite show).\n\n15. I can't sit in a room with a stranger and not make conversation. My body won't let me. I love to talk. \n\n16. I'm insanely handsome. (This is kinda a check to see if people are still reading)\n\n17. I have to use proper punctuation, grammar, and spelling when I text. Nothing irks me more than when someone uses \"u\" without trying to be ironic. lyk if u agree\n\n18. I love board games. Taboo, Cranium, Apples to Apples... I could play these forever. \n\n19. I've actually never visited the Harvard campus! I can't wait for VISITAS.\n\n20. I spent quite a bit more time than I should have trying to come up with these facts... \n\nI hope that was somewhat interesting!

Really hope I can connect with at least some of you before we all meet each other in several months!","picture":"https://fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net/hprofile-ak-ash2/1076462_1550065108_927743325_q.jpg"},{"from":{"name":"Handong Park","id":"100000574424214"},"to":{"data":[{"name":"Harvard Class of 2018","id":"601401026562908"}]},"message":"Sorry I'm so late guys! Here are my twenty (plus one) facts:\n\n1. I absolutely LOVE snow. I love the stunning white landscapes, the cold weather, the unique snowflakes, and everything else that comes with it. I've always wanted to move up north just because we don't get much snow where I live. (To put that in perspective, we've had more snow in the last week than we did all of the past two winters combined.) I actually run my own weather blog solely dedicated to forecasting the little snow we get around here!\n2. When I say \"around here\" I mean to say that I live in Timonium, MD, just a few minutes north of downtown Baltimore (this is why I am a snow-deprived child).\n3. I moved to the U.S. just about six months after being born in Seoul, South Korea, and have lived here ever since.\n4. I speak English, I'm relatively fluent in Korean, and I'm trying to learn French. \n5. I play two instruments – piano and flute – because I love music. When I hear or play music, it just vibrates from my ears to my toes to my fingers and my nose and I feels amazing inside. \n6. My favorite foods are (including, but not limited to): lasagna, sushi, instant ramen, freshly cooked ramen, fondue, Korean barbecue, any pasta you can think of, lamb chops, ribeye steak, snickerdoodle cookies...\n7. As you can probably tell from the above, I love food! I will eat almost anything. Scratch that – save mushrooms. I will eat anything that does not involve the distinct taste of mushrooms!\n8. My favorite TV shows of all time include House, Sherlock, The Colbert Report, The Daily Show, Monk, Suits, Burn Notice, Avatar: The Last Airbender, Phineas and Ferb, and finally, Gilmore Girls (more on this one later!).\n9. Movies-wise, I love almost everything I've watched. Out of all of them, Inception holds a special place in my heart. The Harry Potter movies are also some of my absolute favorites, although they don't totally capture all the witty dialogue from the books that I adored.\n10. Speaking of Harry Potter, although I've played tennis since I was five, I'm really interested in joining the Quidditch team at Harvard!\n11. And speaking of tennis, each summer, I volunteer at the Citi Open (formerly the Legg Mason Tennis Classic) in Washington D.C., as a ballboy. I've been on TV a few times in the process (pretty fun!) but never for more than two or three seconds in a row.\n12. I am a diehard Ravens fan. Moving to Boston will never change that about me. I also follow the British Premier League (I try to watch every game that shows up on TV these days). My favorite team is Cardiff City, with Chelsea (Oscar is great, I've had my eye on him for years!) in a close second and Everton in third (Roberto Martinez is one of my favorite coaches of all time).\n13. When it comes to classical music, Ravel, Shostakovich, Brahms and Chopin are my favorite composers. When it comes to music in general, Norah Jones (I've listened to the “Come Away With Me” album thousands of times and I still love it) and Radiohead are also favorites. And I'm a Taylor Swift fan when it comes to “pop” music.\n14. I have a Playstation, a Playstation 2, a Playstation 3, and now a Playstation 4. Yup, I'm a Playstation gamer for life and I firmly believe that Playstation beats XBox any day.\n15. Dancing in the rain (and getting soaked) is one of my favorite things to do in the summertime, especially during huge downpours. I used to hate getting wet as a kid, but one day in the middle of the Blue Ridge Mountains in North Carolina, I got caught in the rain and enjoyed it. I've been hooked ever since.\n16. My biggest weakness – I stink at dancing. That's why I play flute instead. \n17. My biggest strength – I have a knack for coming up with ridiculous and over-the-top (and sometimes really bad) analogies for everything I encounter. And, I'm overly enthusiastic, energetic, and passionate about everything, from music to politics and MUN to these twenty facts. (I've probably used way too many exclamation points including this last one!) Almost every personality test I've taken has called “zest” or “enthusiasm” one of my top strengths.\n18. I'm interested in math, and particularly statistics and data.\n19. When I was five, I watched lots of Gilmore Girls (still enjoy it when I find reruns on TV). According to my mom, one day, I asked her “what Harvard was,” since Rory (originally) wanted to get into Harvard. She told me that “Harvard is the best school in the world.” Apparently I was convinced by that one statement, and told her that I was going to Harvard no matter what. (Apparently I even told all my other first grade friends and teachers too.) Reaching that dream and meeting you all has made this weekend the most amazing, most inspiring, most exciting of my life. After reading all of the cool tidbits about everybody, I seriously can't wait for Visitas - you guys are all awesome! I absolutely can't wait to meet everybody here, and I send you all my love and congratulations!!! (Note: When Rory chose Yale, I definitely felt betrayed.)\n20. On a final note, my name is Handong, but since it's hard to pronounce, I get called “H-Dog” or “H-Dawg” a lot by all my friends and teachers.\n21. On a final final note, I wanted to say that I screamed so loud when I found out that our neighbor's dogs started barking. Also I wanted to end on #21 and not #20 because I prefer odd numbers to even numbers (and I have no clue why!)","picture":"https://fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net/hprofile-ak-ash2/1118761_100000574424214_1692445981_q.jpg"},{"from":{"name":"Ted Teo","id":"100002034545052"},"to":{"data":[{"name":"Harvard Class of 2018","id":"601401026562908"}]},"message":"Hi, folks! Sorry I’m late, but here goes!\n1. My name is Ted Waechter, not Ted Teo, but Mom’s read up on online predators and is keeping me safe.\n2. I was born in Hong Kong and lived there for seven years. I deeply regret losing my fluency in Cantonese when we moved away.\n3. After Hong Kong, my family lived in Lucca, Italy, for a year, and I’ve managed to hold onto Italian.\n4. I actually want to pursue a joint concentration in Italian and Gov, I think, but I also want to study African American Studies, history, SGS, and ESPP (and acronyms, obviously).\n5. Now I live in Cary, North Carolina, which is wedged between Duke, UNC, and NC State.\n6. I’m openly gay and do a lot of work outside of school related to LGBT equality and inclusion.\n7. I’m passionate about fighting inequality of all kinds – LGBT, gender, racial, religious, etc.\n8. Income inequality’s been on my mind a lot lately. I just finished Behind the Beautiful Forevers, which is about a slum in India, and Invisible Child, an NYT series on homelessness. I'm now reading Winner-Take-All-Politics, which is about the structural inequality perpetuated by our government.\n9. I am obsessively sharing this video. \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPKKQnijnsM\n10. I’m a huge progressive, and my two favorite political figures right now are Elizabeth Warren and Nichi Vendola, Italy’s first LGBT regional president.\n11. I compete in Congressional debate and write political op-eds for my school newspaper.\n12. I hate reading fiction; my favorite book is The New Jim Crow, an analysis of racism in our criminal justice system.\n13. I tend to read multiple books on a given subject before jumping to something totally different. This fall, it was the 2012 election and DC, so I read Double Down, Collision 2012, and This Town.\n14. I have four books about Theodore Roosevelt on my desk right now, so I think that’ll be the theme of my upcoming winter break.\n15. I have a younger sister in 9th grade and a black lab. Both speak Italian, too.\n16. I spend every summer at Lago del Bosco, an Italian immersion program in Minnesota.\n17. This year, I helped an octogenarian cheese master teach campers how to make mozzarella.\n18. I’m not into organized sports, but I’m always walking my dog and I love to hike when I get the chance.\n19.

I’m from Plymouth, Minnesota and I’m a senior at Wayzata High School. That means I’m basically always cold because it snows here. A lot. \n2. I absolutely love raspberries and dark chocolate. Chocolate covered raspberries are life changing. \n3. My favorite TV shows are Dance Moms and Awkward. \n4. I love debate! I’ve been involved in policy debate for the past four years and have been captain for two of them. I’ve spent every summer at debate camp, and our team competes nationally. I think I might want to debate at Harvard.\n5. Thanks to debate, I also really like talking. People have difficulty getting me to stop talking. \n6. I spend most of my free time dancing. I know four classical Indian dance forms, and choreographing my own contemporary pieces is a lot of fun too. \n7. My favorite book is Jane Eyre, even though the ending is a little questionable. \n8. I watch way too many chick flicks. Possibly every single Nicholas Sparks movie. \n9. My favorite movie is Despicable Me. \n10. I want a minion for Christmas. \n11. I am fluent in Malayalam, which is a south Indian language. Most people haven’t heard of it. \n12. I was born in Montana. \n13. I love the sciences! I think I want to major in biomedical engineering.\n14. I have a foreign policy update alarm on my phone, but it hasn’t updated in three months.

I posted a list days ago but took it down immediately because I feared it might end up on the accepted2018 hall of shame. Well, sod it. Here's to self-immolation.)\n\n1. I'm Lil from across the pond. I honestly can't wait to be properly Americanised. I've always been fascinated by how warm Americans are (You give hugs gratuituously, say LOL and OMG excessively, and you all give your applause so generously (at least on Ellen)). In the UK, this Midwestern friendliness is considered impolite, impertinent, and ocassionally mad. \n\nProtip from Kate Fox: \"Our reserve is a form of courtesy – the kind of courtesy that the sociolinguists Brown and Levinson call ‘negative politeness’, meaning that it is concerned with other people’s need not to be intruded or imposed upon (as opposed to ‘positive politeness’, which is concerned with their need for inclusion and social approval). The  restraint, cautiousness and contact-avoidance of English public-transport passengers – the stand-offishness that foreigners complain about – are all characteristic features of ‘negative politeness’. What looks like unfriendliness is really a kind of consideration: we judge others by ourselves, and assume that everyone shares our obsessive need for privacy – so we mind our own business and politely ignore them.\"\n\n2. I love horses and riding horses. I once dreamt I won the Grand National (as the horse) and feel an affinity for Lady Bamford's horse Sariska, who decided not to exit the starting stalls at the end of her career: I too like to decide when I go to the gym.\n\n3. I blush - or should I say turn crimson - when I lie. I'm hopeless at it.\n\n4. I still remember the horror of my first piano recital. The kid before me played Beethoven. I played \"Chopsticks\".\n\n5. I couldn't live without my most excellent beagle, Poppy and cat, Misty -- an apogee of a rare and elite breed loaded with attitude. She does not like being snatched from her sheepskin rug and subjected to an 'undignified journey in a basket'.\n\n6. I know Krav Maga. Seriously, London life is rough, and one must know how to defend oneself especially if you're a girl.\n\n7. My party trick is leaving before things get messy. My friends hate this about me because they always take the rap and I don't haha. Although I can move a covertly placed fork under a napkin and making it appear as if something ghostly is lifting it up. It works on kids, but my cousin has stolen said trick and is giving the game away.\n\n8. I'm a firm believer in the power of high heels, crisps, and homework. I'm also a grammar Nazi, and like most grammar Nazis I'm not grammatically correct 100% of the time. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3y0CD2CoCs \n\n9. I love obscure books/obscure knowledge. I guess you could call me an intellectual hipster or annoyingly pretentious. Currently, I'm into Vladimir Sorokin. Oh and I also love irony.\n\n10. I value honesty and the proverbial search for the truth. Veritas (it's meant to be haha). That being said, confession: I really wish it didn't sound like pigs were being killed whenever I sing.\n\n11. I tend to have long late night philosophical/existentialist discussions with my friends at random coffee shops. Gems include: \"Camus skirted the post-war resurgence of existentialism, and indeed is often thought,  perhaps mistakenly, to have been an existentialist. But actually, he's more of an absurdist. In 1942 he published L'Etranger and Le Mythe de Sisyphe in which he sees the absurdity of man's condition. He had little sympathy with Sartre's attempt to define new moral codes, being more interested in practical morality and in social justice which he considered all the more important because he found the state of man to be absurd.\" J/K. It's really just an excuse for us to get wasted.\n\n12.  At said coffee shops, I would never order a cappuccino. I only ever drink half-soy, half-goat's milk, extra hot, 3 shot (single origin) cortados with a quarter of a teaspoon of raw sugar. If I'm feeling really jazzy I may occasionally ask for a dash of cream as a treat.\n\n13-14. I'm finally on my way towards mastering Chopin's Nocturnes (haha I've come a long way since the Chopsticks debacle!) and finishing Infinite Jest!\n\n15. Update: At the moment, I am enjoying a very healthy snack break with my friend Laura in the Royal Suite where Naomi Campbell and the supermodel gang filmed their Duran Duran \"Girl Panic!\" video. Eating adzuki beans, salmon, avocado, capers, tomatoes, drinking sparkling water plus one ham and cheese baguette, 2 French press coffees, one carmelised apple and cinnamon brioche French toast. #HolidayModeOn\n\n16. Not really chuffed about the 21 drinking age, to be honest. My European taste buds have unfortunately become accustomed to accompanying meals with the appropriate wine. I'd only ever eat fish with white wine. Pizzas with barbera. Summer with rosé. Celebrations with pinot noir or sauvignon blanc. #EuropeanProblems\n\n17. White wine, smoked salmon, foie gras, and a symphony by Haydn -- Heaven.\n\n18. Asked during my Oxford interview about the difference between \"lie\", \"deceive\" and \"mislead\", I answered: nothing is more cheering than a baby penguin.\n\n19. I always carry a pocket-sized paperback of Joan Didion's \"Slouching Towards Bethlehem\" with me.\n\n20. List of favourites (non-exhaustive): Books: Anything recommended by Harold Bloom; Art: The Impressionists; American shows: Mad Men, The Good Wife; Composer: Chopin; Music: a bit of EDM, Bastille, The Velvet Underground, Blondie, Joni Mitchell, The Smiths, Kate Bush, Florence + the Machine, The XX, Azta, Fleetwood Mac. I'm also a member of an unlikely (often warring) mix of fandoms: Sherlock, Harry Potter, LOTR, Downton Abbey, Tilda Swinton, Benedict Cumberbatch, Tom Hiddleston, Game of Thrones.  Live fast. Die young. Fangirls do it well (with apologies to M.I.A.).\n\nCongratulations if you finished reading this, and see you at Visitas!","picture":"https://fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net/hprofile-ak-prn2/1116835_100004051083560_1757763463_q.jpg","link":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3y0CD2CoCs","source":"http://www.youtube.com/v/c3y0CD2CoCs?version=3&autohide=1&autoplay=1","name":"That Mitchell and Webb Look Series 4 - Episode 1 (Grammar Nazi)","description":"Be careful with your grammar and pronunciation if you want to survive the boardroom!

So I see everybody's been doing 20 facts about themselves and stuff like that so I figured I would contribute something. I don't know if I can rattle off 20 but I'll right some down as I think of them. Beats studying for Latin.\n\n1. Background: I'm from Greenwich, CT born and raised. My family is all from the Boston area however (Dad is from Brockton and Mom is from Belmont) so I've grown up with a pretty heavy Boston influence (Go Bruins). I'm currently at Brunswick School if any of you know it.\n\n2. Activities (I guess that seems like something to write about): I do a lot of stuff at Brunswick. I'm interested in a pretty good variety of stuff. First off, I'm on the Varsity Wrestling team this year so I'm considering doing some wrestling at a club team level (if there is such a thing) at Harvard (let me know if any of you guys are wrestlers). I'm also pretty active in the theatre at Brunswick.\n\n3. Class interests: I take a lot of classics classes (4 years of Latin and 3 years of Greek). I'm also taking AP US Gov this year which I love. Other than that I usually enjoy a lot of Humanities and Social Sciences classes.\n\n4. What I plan to study at Harvard: The plan has always been to go pre-med, but recently I've been questioning that. A government major sounds nice, but I honestly don't know.\n\n5. Favorite movies: Forrest Gump, American Beauty, Angels With Dirty Faces, Airplane!, Braveheart, any Kubrick, any Tarantino, any Coen Brothers (particularly The Big Lebowski), The Good the Bad and the Ugly, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, LOTR, Michael Collins, There Will Be Blood, Snatch, Taxi Driver, The Departed, The Godfather, I'm a huge movie guy so I could probably make this a whole separate thing but you get the idea...\n\n6. Music: The Grateful Dead will always hold a special place in my heart, definitely my #1. Other than that I honestly like little bits of every genre, but my favorites are usually older classic rock songs. All the obvious ones that come to mind.\n\n7. I went to Oxford and did the OxBridge Academy Oxford Prep program this past summer, which was amazing. Idk if that means anything to anybody but it's worth saying I guess.\n\n8. Usually I spend my summers in Cape Cod. The cape is a huge part of who I am.\n\n9. Are politics something I should put here? I don't know. I'm a Libertarian if anybody cares, but I usually swing right. I will register Republican when I turn 18.\n\n10. TV: Don't watch a lot of this but Star Trek should probably be mentioned. I fancy myself a casual trekkie. Game of Thrones is great too. Other than that its mostly 60 minutes and NBC nightly news with good old Brian Williams.\n\n11. My family is probably worth mentioning. Both sides are almost entirely of Irish descent save for my father's mother's side which is Quebecois. In typical Irish fashion, I am the oldest of seven (a brother, a sister, three half brothers and a half sister) but I don't see them all at once because my parents are divorced so its only ever 5 of us at a time.\n\n12. I can't think of anything else but I mean if you guys want to ask something in the comments then thats cool.","picture":"https://fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net/hprofile-ak-ash2/1086294_1624420092_900751670_q.jpg"},{"from":{"name":"Kevin Wang","id":"100000055574031"},"to":{"data":[{"name":"Harvard Class of 2018","id":"601401026562908"}]},"message":"Five things about myself (because there aren't 20 interesting things about me):\n\n1.

One of my favorite phrases to say is \"I'm perfect,\" which my friends and I call \"aggressive self confidence.\" I don't know why we started doing it, but it is hilarious when people think I'm serious. \"Nobody's perfect, I gotta work it, again and again just to get it right\"~Hannah Montana","picture":"https://fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net/hprofile-ak-ash3/260701_100006507548381_1922074326_q.jpg","link":"https://www.facebook.com/rookiemag.com","name":"Rookie","caption":"www.facebook.com","description":"The Best Site on the Internet.","icon":"https://fbstatic-a.akamaihd.net/rsrc.php/v2/yD/r/aS8ecmYRys0.gif"},{"from":{"name":"Brynn Elliott","id":"100006366606485"},"to":{"data":[{"name":"Harvard Class of 2018","id":"601401026562908"}]},"message":"Hi Everyone!! You are all super fantastic people and I cannot wait to meet you next year :) I am a bit late with my 20 things due to the fact that I am still recovering from the shock of being accepted to Harvard!!! Ahh! But here ya go...\n\n1. I was born and raised in Atlanta, GA. \n\n2. I have been homeschooled my entire life. \n\n3. Number 2 is not a joke and yes, I do indeed have friends...so what if they're imaginary?? (No no, jk they are real!)\n\n4. I want to study Philosophy and Literature! \n\n5. Although I am from the USA, I was under the UK schooling system. Meaning I took IGCSEs and A-Levels! If there is anyone out there who took these show thyself, I would love to compare war wounds! \n\n6. Due to my British school immersion, I know several English people and I love them. \n\n7. I graduated high school this past June and decided to take a gap year. I totally recommend taking a gap year as it had proved a very beneficial experience for me!!!\n\n8. This year I was invited by a Grammy award-winning producer to record an album. So I am living several months in Portland to make the record and hope to do a little tour this summer. My style is folk/pop. Attached is a link to a couple of my songs. A song I wrote \" Dear Anna\" is about Tolstoy's famous literary character! I wrote it while reading the novel because I felt the need to communicate with Anna. So instead of being a crazy person, I wrote a song. \nhttp://www.reverbnation.com/brynnelliott\n \n9.  I still might be a crazy person but that’s a whole other discussion. \n\n10. I was a business and script-reading intern for a film production company in Atlanta for 2 years! I strongly hope to be involved with film things at Harvard as well.\n\n11. I also rode horses for 7 years and competed in the Hunters/Equitation divisions! So I also cannot wait to be involved in athletics at Harvard! \n\n12. I have decently sized scar on my left arm from falling off a horse. It was epic...and it hurt\n\n13. None of my immediate family, including my older brother, have attended  college! So they are very pumped for me.\n\n14. My brother is from Peru and is an amateur golfer. He is pure awesomeness personified.\n\n15. I LOVE HARVARD with all my heart! I went to the summer school and completely fell in love! It has stayed with me so much. The first time I walked on campus it was super early in the morning while I was going for a run. I had this deep, strong feeling it was where I really wanted to be. \n\n16. If you cannot already tell, I am very longwinded. However I do love to listen! \n\n17. My favorite book of all time is Pride and Prejudice! The relational dynamics in that novel are insanely well developed and, I feel, unmatched as of yet in the world of novels. I could go on about it, but I shall spare your Facebook eyes. \n\n18. My favorite film is Babette's Feast. It inspired me to be an artist.\n\n19. My favorite songwriters are Paul Simon, Joni Mitchell, Brooke Fraser, Damien Rice, and Brandi Carlile. And as for bands I love The Head and The Heart, Of Monsters and Men, The Parson Red Heads, Coldplay, and Mumford and Sons. And I would LOVE to hear about your all of your favorite bands/musicians!!!\n\n20. I love love love love coffee and would love to do coffee dates with any and all of you next year:)","picture":"https://fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net/hprofile-ak-prn2/1118901_100006366606485_965639750_q.jpg","link":"http://www.reverbnation.com/brynnelliott","source":"https://gp1.wac.edgecastcdn.net/802892/production/widgets/swf/18/facebook_widget_v3.swf?id=artist_3622562","name":"Brynn Elliott | Singer Songwriter from Atlanta, GA","description":"Singer Songwriter | Atlanta, GA","icon":"https://fbstatic-a.akamaihd.net/rsrc.php/v2/yj/r/v2OnaTyTQZE.gif"},{"from":{"name":"Ben Anandappa","id":"1345455017"},"to":{"data":[{"name":"Harvard Class of 2018","id":"601401026562908"}]},"message":"I think I’m pretty late now but I only found this page today!

I'm a mix of African American, Irish and Italian! Unfortunately no other language besides English could be salvaged from my family... :'( \n3. I'm a vegetarian!! My 2nd grade teacher was one, and she used to be my favorite! I didn't actually officially become one til about 9th grade or so! (I do eat eggs though and am always having debates with my friends about it!)\n4. My favorite thing to eat has to be the creamy tomato soup at Panera. Me gusta\n5. I intern at Brigham and Women's hospital in the Cytogenetics department. This is my third year there!\n6. My favorite sport would have to be soccer, although I'm absolutely horrible at it I plan on doing intramural\n7. I planned on studying biology but lately I've been leaning towards a variety of subjects! Really enjoy my AP Euro class, and my teacher is fresh from Ireland so her accent keeps me awake!\n8. I've taken Latin for 4 years and then decided to stop because...well...I suck! But I'm taking Greek now!\n9. Once I was feeling adventurous so I took a bus to the chinatown in NY, walked to NYC (took like 3 hours) and had fun! We ended up staying overnight; didn't sleep just walked through the city. Definitely was hallucinating that night because I thought a moth was a wolf trying to attack me...\n10. I love the Bronte sisters, and Nathaniel Hawthorne!\n11. I can't swim which is a huge issue\n12. My sister (16) is the complete opposite of me; we're the classic siblings you would see in a movie\n12. I love all types of music/tv shows/movies! As long as I'm with some friends just hanging out I'm content\n13. I love ice skating!! Can't wait to go with you guys hopefully come next winter :)\n14. I have a turtle named stitch (gave Lilo away), 3 cats named Rubio, Abby, and Lola, and a dog named Gizmo\n15. I don't travel a lot but I do plan on studying abroad, even if Harvard frowns upon it (or so I've heard)\n16. I was in a Dunkin Donuts with a few friends when I opened the acceptance email. They screamed and I just sat there in disbelief. I remember my words beforehand were: \"Please don't treat me differently when I get rejected.\" Aha\n17. Does anyone like economics/business? I've been thinking about taking a class but not to sure...help! \n18. I used to be able to play both the drums and the guitar when I was younger, but lack of practice have made me forget. Trying to get my guitar mojo back\n19. I've always wanted to go to Harvard! I honestly didn't even know about any other college when I was younger except Harvard\n20.

I live in Leawood, Kansas, but I go to boarding school in New Hampshire (Phillips Exeter Academy).\n2. Even though I live in Kansas, I don’t actually live on a farm.\n3. I have fenced since I was about 8 or 9 and I can’t wait to fence at Harvard with Hellary and the rest of the team :D My school does not have a fencing team either so I am super excited! Actually, I just fenced in a tournament in Dallas yesterday (and saw Hellary!) so I wrote most of this in the car back from the airport! Ahh...the joy of making up missed days of school…\n4. I love languages!! I took Latin for most of my life but am taking Chinese at school now and it would be soo amazing to continue that but also take even more languages at Harvard!\n5. I also really like economics and history!\n6. Netflix is amazing\n7. I am allergic to dogs, cats, and horses\n8. I used to be allergic to strawberries so I would sneeze whenever I was near one...I’m not really sure how that works now that I think about it but yeahh…\n9. I hate the sound of styrofoam\n10. I have two older brothers (one is at Columbia Law School and the other is at high school at home)\n11. I LOVE listening to music but I can’t sing\n12.

I’m addicted to my piano.\n4. ^^^With that said, I’m a lover of all types of music! Classical, country, bluegrass, jazz, everything. My favorites are Elton John and Billy Joel\n5. I ran Cross Country for all four years of high school. I also love soccer, golf, and table tennis.\n6. Favorite author: Ayn Rand. Howard Roark is definitely the greatest literary badass of all time. Ayn Rand is nearly perfect… except for that part of her that decided that people’s feelings are completely irrelevant.\n7. In stark contrast to number 6, I’m not a huge fan of capitalism. Ironic, yes, but that’s that. The idea of money itself sort of makes me cringe. And nobody call it a necessary evil, because the idea of a necessary evil makes me cringe even more!\n8. Another favorite author (I’m a reader. Who isn’t?): C.S. Lewis. I spent my childhood longing to be in Narnia. Now I spend my teenage days… longing to be in Narnia.\n9. I like people! Talking to people and listening to them and watching their faces when they are happy.\n10. My favorite musical is Urinetown. Oklahoma is great too.\n11. I spent my entire childhood dreaming of becoming the president of this country… things have changed now.\n12. I believe in clothing yourself for comfort. I've perfected the sweatpants/argyle socks/adidas sandals look (my father looked at me one morning and said, “It looks like you’ve given up!” Yes, my father said this.)\n13. Terence McKenna is my intellectual hero. If you know him, PLEASE be my friend! If not, I will gladly share! \n14. I have an extra rib and an extra lobe in my left lung. The result=my chest is slightly deformed . Oh well. \n15. Favorite film: Donnie Darko. \n16. I don’t eat meat, and I've spent the past two years experimenting with veganism and raw veganism. I love kale, watermelon, durian, and fresh almond milk!\n17. I might concentrate in music. Though I’m so tempted to study something I've never looked at before. Celtic Languages, Folklore, something like that. I’m interested in everything, as I’m sure everyone else here is as well!\n18. I’m the captain of the improv comedy troupe at my high school. But I’m not funny.\n19. (…laughs?)\n20. Favorite quote: “Well, let's say this Twinkie represents the normal amount of psychokinetic energy in the New York area. Based on this morning's sample, it would be a Twinkie... thirty-five feet long, weighing approximately six hundred pounds.”","picture":"https://fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net/hprofile-ak-ash2/1076588_100000086527333_560053456_q.jpg"},{"from":{"name":"John Bowers","id":"1091343877"},"to":{"data":[{"name":"Harvard Class of 2018","id":"601401026562908"}]},"message":"Given that I'm sitting here snowbound with no finals to study for, I thought I might as well take the opportunity to share my 20 facts.

Love both places, but it looks like NE is in the cards!\n2. I love reading.  Looking forward to doing a whole lot more of it now that studying is no longer necessary.  Currently, my favorite authors are Vonnegut, Hemingway, Orwell, Murakami, and Fitzgerald.\n3.  I'm moderately adept at French, planning on studying it further at Harvard.  Pretty ok at English, too.\n4. My favorite subjects are English, History, Life Science, and Mathematics.  This poses something of an issue with regards to choosing a major (concentration? whatever we're calling them).\n5. I've run Track and Cross Country since middle school.  I'm not phenomenal, but it's a whole lot of fun.  Hoping there's some sort of a running club at Harvard.\n6. I've debated competitively for the last 3 years, and am currently the captain of my school's debate team.  I've probably gone up against some of you.\n7.  I started a Philosophy in Film club at my school during sophomore year.  It's a bunch of fun; I'd love to bring something similar to Harvard.\n8. In terms of my personal philosophy, I'd call myself a Camus-inspired Absurdist.\n9. I love classical history.  The late Roman republic is my area of specialty.\n10. I can cook pretty well.  Happy to teach anyone who's interested.\n11. My favorite food is pheasant (strange, I know).  Pizza works too.\n12. NPR is my favorite thing ever.  This American Life, Wait Wait Don't Tell Me, Science Friday, and Fresh Air are particular favorites.  \n13. In terms of music, I'll listen to pretty much anything.  Jazz, Classical, and Indie Rock are probably my favorite genres.  I <3 Bach.\n14. My favorite movie is probably either Dr. Strangelove or Pulp Fiction\n15. I freakin' love the New Yorker.  Holy crap.\n16. My favorite TV show is The Wire.  \n17. Gmail's spam filter ate my acceptance email.  Didn't figure it out for like 2 hours.  Bad times, man.\n18. Upon finding my acceptance email I printed it out and folded it into a swan.  Just felt like the thing to do.\n19. I love creative writing.  It's hard to find time to do any these days, but when I can it's immensely therapeutic.\n20. Really looking forward to meeting you guys.

I don't know what I want to do with my life, probably math, science, or engineering though\n15. I have dual citizenship (American and Canadian)\n16. I like cats\n17. Also kittens\n18. Kittens in sweaters\n19. Can't forget about the puppies\n20.

I've been pretty busy. I felt like I was floating through my school halls today. Here goes my 20 facts:\n\n1. I live in Virginia Beach, VA, but am the opposite of a beach boy. This is probably due to the fact that I lived in Northern Virginia all but the past two years of my life.\n2. Soccer is awesome, and I hope to play club so I have time for my other interests. I will also play pick-up basketball anytime despite my unintimidating 5’7” height, and play intensely competitive ping-pong.\n3. My dog Rocco is awesome even at 13 years. Our guinea pig Rochelle is semi-cute but freaks me out a little. \n4. I am the oldest of 4 children (2 brothers and 1 sister), and I think my siblings are the coolest people ever. \n5. I have recently been reading up on Christopher Langan and I might actually agree with his Cognitive-Theoretic Model of the Universe. Before I can decide I’ll have to devote a lot more time trying to understand it. \n6. I love arguing about anything, so I look forward to becoming a part of Harvard’s Mock Trial.\n7. I am currently re-reading Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell, although I rarely re-read or re-watch anything by choice.\n8. I love the TV shows Suits and Arrested Development.\n9. I have too many favorite books to name one but most recently I enjoyed reading Mrs. Dalloway and Native Son.\n10. I’ve been taking Latin since 5th grade and believe firmly in the classical education model.\n11. I attained my personal highest vertical (jump) on Friday at 3:30 after seeing the word “Congratulations!” in my email.\n12. I have too many interests to constrain into one major so I’m kind of worried about that. I think I want to go to law school but I’m not 100% sure.\n13. My mom said she hadn't screamed that loud in 20 years when I got in.\n14. Starting in second semester, I look forward to enjoying more things in life outside of my course load (a job maybe?).\n15. I use the dash all the time when I write -- that’s how I finished my Common App essay.\n16. I have developed a theory that all Latin teachers are awesome and insane (in a good way) -- mens sana in corpore sano?\n17. I’m listening to Childish Gambino right now, but my musical tastes fluctuate weekly.\n18. I love to travel. The best place I’ve been so far is probably Yosemite National Park, which I visited this summer with my dad.\n19. For my senior project I plan on continuing an after-school Latin program I developed last year at a local elementary school.\n20. I plan on spending my second semester reading as much as possible, learning about random interesting things, and resuming my social life.","picture":"https://fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net/hprofile-ak-prn1/41461_100001514222215_1843116411_q.jpg"},{"from":{"name":"Mark Bode","id":"1458623449"},"to":{"data":[{"name":"Harvard Class of 2018","id":"601401026562908"}]},"message":"Hello friends! Just got on here, took the weekend and Monday to get over the post-acceptance daze. Guess I'll go ahead with the 20 facts thing…\n\n1. I'm from suburban Indianapolis and have lived in Avon since I was two years old.\n2. I have an older brother who's a freshman at Notre Dame and a younger sister who's a freshman at our high school (he's 6'5\" and she's 6'1\", leaving me with the short end of the genetic good fortune).\n3. My mother is a school administrator and my father is a family practice doctor.\n4. I'm a die-hard Detroit Lions fan, though I also like the hometown Pacers and Colts, as well as the Boston Red Sox.\n5. I played tennis for the high school team during my four years and have done the statistics for the boys' basketball team all four years as well.\n6. I'm the president of our high school student government after stints as parliamentarian and class president during previous years. \n7. I'm interested in the political field, with (perhaps misguided?) aspirations to run for office someday.\n8. I love watching Saturday Night Live, that's essentially the only TV I watch besides sports. \n9. My main reads are magazines- The New Yorker, The Economist, The New York Times Magazine, Bloomberg Businessweek, S.I., ESPN The Mag.\n10. I love Grantland, Bill Simmons' website. Y'all need to check that one out.\n11. I'm a member of the Presbyterian Church.\n12. I love Kanye West, Yeezus is on constant play in my car. Lana Del Rey, too.\n13. My life is incomplete without the Fiddler on the Roof.\n14. I've never seen a diamond in the flesh.\n15. I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies.\n16. I'm not proud of my address.\n17. Just kidding.\n18. I'm having difficulty studying for finals this week. Currently avoiding that in order to do this.\n19. My family has two kittens that are about three months old. I have the scratches on my legs to prove it.\n20. I hope I can make it with all you talented people. I can't wait to meet you!","picture":"https://fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net/hprofile-ak-prn1/211344_1458623449_2024038152_q.jpg"},{"from":{"name":"Peter Chang","id":"100000049964628"},"to":{"data":[{"name":"Harvard Class of 2018","id":"601401026562908"}]},"message":"Finally decided to join in on all of this. Here we go!!!!\n\n1. I was born in Chicago, moved when I was 6 weeks old, and moved again when I was ten months old.\n2. I've lived in Johnson City, Tennessee since then. (Eastern corner of the state)\n3. I'm a big time golfer and I plan on trying to walk on to the golf team.\n4. I taught myself breakdancing and I'm pretty much the only one at my school who dances.  It's been pretty lonely doing talent show stuff alone but I'm going to try to join a dance crew if golf doesn't work out.\n5. I have a sister who is a sophomore at Harvard right now as well as an even older sister and a younger brother.\n6. I joined the diving team at my school this year purely for kicks and giggles and I'm having a great time.\n7. I got my acceptance email while on a bus to a dive meet but everybody was asleep so I didn't want to wake them up.  When I tried calling my family, my mom was taking a nap, my dad was working and had his phone on silent, my oldest sister was having lunch with a friend and ignored my call, my other sister was taking her final exams, and my younger brother was in a swim meet. So much for spreading the news...\n8. I'm Korean but don't speak a lick of the language.\n9. I am OBSESSED with kimchi. I would compare it with perhaps a mild cocaine addiction. I make my own with my mom although it still isn't quite as good as my grandma's\n10. My favorite book series is the Ender's Game series although I didn't like the movie at all.\n11. On the other hand, I think Peter Jackson is doing a great job so far with the Hobbit. However, I do think they could've easily done it in two movies.\n12. Still talking books here? Alright, I think that the third Hunger Games is a horrible book and is the biggest let down of any series.\n13. My friend convinced me and a bunch of other people including my English teacher to play League of Legends this spring. Just created an account so if anyone wants to play my name is EpilepticBurritoMobile. Strikes fear in the heart doesn't it?\n14. My family has a long history with the University of Michigan so I'm a Wolverine. I do wish we had a better football team though... I was at the OSU vs. Michigan game and I'm still sad about that almost great victory.\n15. I completely break the stereotype that Asians are good at playing piano. I played for eight years and was HORRIBLE. Quite in eighth grade and never looked back.\n16. I think I want to study engineering, physics, or possibly economics while at Harvard but I'm taking the first year undecided. High school did nothing to expose me to true professions, it just peaked my interest in some.\n17. My favorite video games are Super Smash Bros. Melee (Jigglypuff ftw!), Pokemon Puzzle League, and Star Fox 64\n18. I play a lot of ultimate frisbee since both of my sisters play for the college teams. Both of them went to nationals to play, pretty cool stuff.\n19. I like to brag about my brother because he is a ridiculously good swimmer. He's the fastest in breast stroke for 15 year olds.\n20. I'm really skinny and so I have a competition against my dad going from Christmas to my birthday (May 24th). I have to gain more weight than he loses. Money is on the line but more importantly, bragging rights are on the line. I'm too competitive to lose this.\n\nSuper excited to have gotten into Harvard and I'll see you guys at Visitas!","picture":"https://fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net/hprofile-ak-prn2/186099_100000049964628_1672879029_q.jpg"},{"from":{"name":"Luis Nario-Malberg","id":"726122167"},"to":{"data":[{"name":"Harvard Class of 2018","id":"601401026562908"}]},"message":"Hey guys, looking forward to going to school with everyone. \n\n1.  I was born in Santiago, Chile. My parents are Chilean and Puerto Rican. \n2. I was raised mostly in London, UK and New Haven, CT (most of my friends are Yalies so I guess I'm a traitor). Lived in SW Florida for a couple years.\n2. Die hard Arsenal supporter! If there's any footy fans out there I look forward to watching and playing some matches next year. \n3. Big music enthusiast. I play the clarinet and guitar, particularly like rock, folk, blues and jazz. \n4. Plan to major in Electrical engineering or Neuroscience.\n5. I love Monty Python. Life of Brian is probably my favorite movie by them.\n6. Went to the Harvard summer school for the last two years, any of you guys go as well? \n7. My favorite author is Malcolm Gladwell.\n8. My favorite band is either The Strokes or The Grateful Dead.\n9. My favorite movie is 2001: A Space Odyssey. \n10. I'm a fan of Doctor Who.\n11. Hoping to try and start a band at Harvard. Anybody interested?\n12. I have been involved in  theatre at my school for the last two years, I'd say I'm open to trying my hand at in college.\n13. I hate snow with a burning passion. It was cool the first time, but after shoveling it, I hate it.\n14. My whole family are native Spanish speakers, but my Spanish is pretty woeful. \n15. My favorite tv show is either Futurama or South Park. I know they might be considered a little crude or low brow by Harvard standards, but think some of the satire they do is brilliant.\n16. I have two Pugs named Frank and Joey. They aren't exactly the most masculine dogs, but I love em.\n17. I honestly did not believe I would get accepted to Harvard. \n18. My first reaction to getting in was shock. Didn't start celebrating until a couple hours later. \n19. Living in New Haven, I have gone to \"The Game\" a couple of times now. I look forward to supporting the winning team now. (really though, it's hardly even a rivalry at this point)\n20. I have practiced Tae Kwon Do since I was five.

Alright, here are my 20:\n\n1. I live in Stone Ridge, NY. It’s a hamlet with about 700 people and as many cows. It’s pretty rural.\n2. Originally, I’m from nyc, but my parents moved the family upstate when I was 7.\n3. I’m an only child.\n4. I’m embarrassingly obsessed with my dog. He’s a 100 lb Newfoundland mutt of some sort.\n5. I ski and play tennis. I’m alright at both but mostly I just do them for enjoyment. I want to play club or intramural tennis at Harvard.\n6. Currently I’m reading David Copperfield by Dickens. So far, it’s one of the best books I’ve read.\n7. I’m just finishing up two classes at Bard College, Medieval Crusading Literature and 20th Century Russian History... so many hipsters.\n8. I’ve kept beehives since 7th grade. The honey only tastes sweeter after you’ve been stung a few times.\n9. My elementary school put on a circus every year. Somehow I’ve retained the ability to juggle and unicycle. Unfortunately, I can’t do them at the same time\n10. I could eat oysters for days on end.\n11. I’ve always really loved hip hop/rap.  Kendrick Lamar, K’naan are good. Also, lately I like bluegrass music quite a bit and I want to learn to play banjo or bluegrass guitar. Dan Tyminski, Allison Krauss, The Infamous Stringdusters are great. If by any chance someone else likes bluegrass please send me links to more music/ talk to me about it.\n12. I sing tenor in my high school’s Concert Choir and vocal jazz ensemble. It’s so much fun, I want to join some singing groups at Harvard.\n13. My favorite shows: Boardwalk Empire, Game of Thrones, Angry Boys.\n14.I’m building a healthy addiction to Rome Total War and Empire Total War. \n15. Last July, I traveled solo for the first time, and ended up not being able to find where I was supposed to stay (it was some weird setup with Imperial College). I wandered the streets of London for 2-3 hours at night until someone finally helped me out. Besides that, the trip was epic and I want to do more world traveling this summer.\n16. Over the last two summers, I worked in the Silver Lab at Harvard Medical School. I did a project where I engineered E. coli to overproduce precursor molecules for second generation biofuels. I really came to love Harvard during that time and was blown away by how interesting and generous everyone I met was.\n17. I want to continue working/interning in the field of synthetic biology. Harvard has some of the best synbio researchers in the world, Pam Silver, George Church. As if that’s not enough MIT is basically next door. Could it be any sweeter?\n18. While I find biology to be fascinating, I’m not 100% all about science/math (though I can see why someone would be). I’m a bit of a history buff as well. I’m down 24/7 any day of the week to talk about World War 2, or the American Civil War with anyone who wants to (seriously). \n19. I’ve seen the most amazing things listed in your 20 facts. I cannot wait to meet all of you at Visitas (which happens to fall on my birthday; thank you for the present Harvard).\n20. It’s been my dream to go to Harvard for as long as I can remember.

I’m from Fort Worth, TX, which is NOT Dallas\n2.) My parents hail from Mexico, and only Spanish can be spoken once I cross the threshold of my house\n3.) My middle and last name is Rodriguez here in the States. A bit quirky, but my parents had the same paternal last name before they were married, so I inherited both by Hispanic custom\n4.) I wore a Yale shirt the day after I got accepted. I’m so sorry if this offends anyone. I honestly don’t know what drove me to do this\n5.) I have worn the exact same type of shoes since freshman year. I just replace the pair with an exact same one whenever the current shoes can’t take another step\n6.) I sincerely believe that Qdoba is a better restaurant than Chipotle. Chipotle doesn’t even offer the option to put queso in your burritos\n7.) Baseball is the greatest sport of all time, and I follow the MLB on a daily basis even if I don’t play\n8.) In my opinion, Doctor Who and Parks and Rec are the greatest TV shows of all time\n9.) I love satire. Bo Burnham’s “what.” was just released today as a CD on iTunes and the special is on Netflix and his YouTube channel if anyone is interested\n10.) My music interests range from Vampire Weekend to what some would consider rather inappropriate rap. But hey as long as it’s catchy!\n11.) Geocaching is one of my favorite outdoor activities\n12.) Frisbee is also fun. Hopefully I can play on the Harvard ultimate club team\n13.) I want to try out some art / creative classes in college.

I'm so excited to get to know you all, I'm already so in awe of the facts you've posted. But, if there's anything I can do well, it's hop on a bandwagon, so here it goes:\n1. My name is Polish, and the trick to pronouncing it is making the \"sz\" sound like an \"sh\" when you are saying it. If that doesn't suit you I have a pretty wide assortment of nicknames to chose from, anything from Lele to Shekkie Green (my friends are pretty creative.)\n2. I'm a stress rapper. For some reason, being able to rap along with the Epic Rap Battles is a great way for me to relieve tension.\n3. I'm a cat person, even though I'm pretty sure I'm mildly allergic...it's worth the sniffles.\n4. I have really weird musical tastes, meaning that I can listen to classical, followed by rap, followed by metal. The one thing I can't stand is too much of the same thing.\n5. I have a really low-brow sense of humor. The Scary Movie franchise is cinematic gold in my eyes. ;)\n6. I have a mild Facebook group-making addiction. I've basically made one for every class I'm in.\n7. I'm an only child, which I think in the end is a pretty sweet bargain, the whole not having to share your parent's attention or live up to your sibling is overall a nice bargain.\n8. I've been on Facebook for less than a year and Twitter for less than two. I'm a relative newbie to social media. \n9. I'm going into Harvard undeclared so that I can try to find something I'd be happy doing the rest of my life (I think that's a little bit of a burden for high school seniors, no?)\n10. I have an incredible love for raspberry iced tea at any time of year.\n11. My high school's fan section is called the Red Sea, so I'm moving from the Red to Crimson.\n12. My handwriting has been described as less legible than hieroglyphics by basically every one of my teachers since the first grade.\n13.  I live about 45 minutes away from Boston, in the northeast corner of Massachusetts (the geographical variety among us is actually amazing to me)\n14. I still have a Freshman backpack in my Senior year.\n15. I'll often sing along with songs even though I know my voice is terrible (my rendition of Staying Alive cracks windows.)\n16. I love food but don't really have the patience or skill for cooking (which often leads half cooked meals, so I've learned to like al dente pasta)\n17. I hate shoveling snow (there was a snow storm up here yesterday over the weekend, so that's still on my mind.)\n18. I have man crushes on Jonny Lee Miller and Gabriel Macht (Suits and Elementary are two of my favorite shows)\n19. I regularly watch the Daily Show and Colbert Report and would LOVE to go to a taping at some point.\n20.

I taught myself how to speak Spanish, and I'll be teaching Spanish classes at my church in the near future\n4. I play four different instruments well (trumpet, sax, flute, and clarinet), but I dabble in the french horn and piano\n5. I'm probably the first person in my high school's history to get accepted to Harvard (est. 1925-ish) and I think the second or third to get accepted to an Ivy League School\n6. I LOVE to sing. I even sent in a recording of me singing \"Georgia on my Mind\" as an Art Supplement\n7. I play varsity football and track and field but I'm not a recruit\n8. On my 17th birthday, the world was \"supposed\" to end (12/21/12)\n9. I first heard of Harvard when I was 10 from \"Sister, Sister\" when Tia wanted to go there.\n10. I'm a huge fan of strawberry milk\n11. Speaking of being a huge fan, GO JETS!\n12. I do drama at my school and this year I'm playing Nicky in my school's production of Avenue Q\n13. I'm black (if it wasn't obvious)\n14. Now I can stop reading CC all night\n15. I've never been to Harvard (yet) so Visitas should be an interesting experience\n16. My favorite sport is basketball, even though I don't play for my high school\n17. My favorite color is red (which is cool, because crimson is a type of red)\n18. I lost my home in Hurricane Sandy and finally (after 14 months) I will be moving back into my newly-built house (on Christmas Eve, no less!)\n19. Right now I'm spearheading a huge fundraiser that will help those still displaced by Sandy as well as funding the Eliminate Project to help eradicate neonatal tetanus\n20.

Born in Preston, Idaho, but I have since moved on to Las Vegas, Nevada, and now live in Acton, California.\n\n2. I was homeschooled for a good chunk of my life (4th to 10th grade), but I managed to turn out decent.\n\n3. I've lived in every continental U.S. time zone and have been to more than half of all U.S. states.\n\n4. I've played hockey since I was 4 and I am going to continue playing at Harvard. It helps to know that I'm a goalie, too.\n\n5. I was drafted by the Philadelphia Flyers this past year.\n\n6. I am truly a dog person, and thankfully my family has four big dogs: two australian shepherds, one labrador retriever, and one lab mix we adopted.\n\n7. I enjoy reading, and I wish I had done more reading in my childhood. I'm currently going through all of Steve Berry's novels.\n\n8. As far as music, I'm not super picky. As of late I've really delved into EDM, anything from Calvin Harris to Kat Krazy to Deadmau5.\n\n9. I've seen a couple people say this, but I like messing with Rubik's cubes and can solve a couple different ones. Looking to get some bigger ones soon.\n\n10. I'm 6' 5\" and I'll probably grow another inch or so.\n\n11. I actually committed to play hockey at Harvard in the summer of 2012, and I've been sporting a Harvard hat and sweatshirt since. So just remember it's never too early to start representing.\n\n12. For whatever reason, I'm an early bird and always seem to be the first one up wherever I live. Unfortunately, this has started to be accompanied by me being a night owl and being the last to bed. Not good.\n\n13. At different points in my life, I've roomed with a Spaniard, a Swede, a Belarusian, and now with a Russian. \n\n14. My instagram is @merrickmadsen29, and so is my twitter for those of you who want to know.\n\n15. I've actually already visited Harvard numerous times and it is an absolutely stunning campus and I'm really excited to be living in Boston.\n\n16. I took Spanish for about six years and still haven't figured it out to my dismay. I want to take another crack at it at Harvard.\n\n17. Like most you I'll go in undeclared, but I've been very interested in biology, specifically genetics and human development. I wouldn't be surprised if I ultimately declare a concentration in human evolutionary biology, human developmental and regenerative biology, or neurobiology.\n\n18. I actually graduated high school this past year from Proctor Academy in New Hampshire, but I'm keeping busy with online classes this year to stay in mental shape.\n\n19. Favorite TV Shows have to be Family Guy, That 70's Show, Friends, Modern Family, Breaking Bad, and New Girl.\n\n20.

So I just go with that.\n2. When I applied to Harvard, I thought I had no chance because I’m just one Chinese guy among hundreds of millions of other Chinese applicants…tell me I’m not the only one who thought this!\n3. Because of this, my motto for college apps is “set high goals and low expectations.”\n4. My nickname is “the Jiang Bang” – came up with this when I was an innocent, naïve seventh grader, so I didn’t know it sounded sexual until it was too late. \n5. I have a YouTube channel called TheJiangBang.\n6. I make weekly Instagram videos to educate, entertain, and embarrass (myself).\n7. As you can probably tell, I like making videos. I’m also into photography and photo editing.\n8. I have skin as thick as an elephant’s and I LOVE pulling awkward pranks in public. For April Fools this year, I went around school consuming mayonnaise (actually yogurt) straight from the jar. LAHWF on YouTube is my idol. \n9.

After my friend introduced me to it, I’m one of the few people I know who actively listen to House. If anyone is interested, Miami 82 by Syn Cole is an amazing song to rock out to in the car.\n12. I often mishear things, so even though I’ve spent most of my life speaking English, I need subtitles to watch movies. \n13. I use the word “wily” very liberally, and it can mean pretty much mean anything when I say it. \n14. I suck at Fantasy Basketball…I didn’t know how to switch players off the bench for the first three weeks of the season, so now I’m screwed.\n15. I’m an avid street magic performer. I actually showed a card trick at the end of my Harvard interview…so if anyone asks how I got in, the answer is magic. \n16. California Youth & Government delegate! Any other kids from Y&G here? \n17. The greatest accolade I have ever received is the Fatburger Triple King Challenge award. I actually put this on my Common App. \n18. I run cross country. I’m not the fastest or the most improved – my PR was set at my first race I ever ran – but I still love the sport and my teammates. \n19. There is no greater satisfaction in life than guessing a punchline correctly. \n20. After reading the previous posts, I have concluded that you all are wonderful individuals very excited about going to this school. I’m not fully committed to Harvard yet (still gonna apply to and compare other colleges. does anyone know how good the bio/pre-med is here?) – but if I do, it won’t be for the prestige or for the school itself. Harvard is just a collection of fancy looking buildings. College is defined by the friends you make and the connections you form, so if I do go to Harvard, it’ll be because I know amazing people like you guys will be there.","picture":"https://fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net/hprofile-ak-ash2/1119308_100001016565263_356402838_q.jpg"},{"from":{"name":"Robby Erikson","id":"100002590444796"},"to":{"data":[{"name":"Harvard Class of 2018","id":"601401026562908"}]},"message":"I'm late but here goes:\n1.

My Dad is originally from Bangladesh, and my Mom is from India, so I learned to speak and am fluent in Bangla, Hindi, and Urdu\n4. I love MUSIC, regardless of the genre; I listen to pretty much everything\n5. I’m really into Biology, Economics, and History, so I’m still undecided about what my concentration will be\n6.

Don’t even get me started on how many cousins I have…..\n10. My Dad and my two younger brothers also have the name Mirza Uddin. This has led to some of the biggest confusions in my life. I’ll tell you guys about it later, can’t spill the beans all at once ;)\n11. I love the Yankees, The Giants, and the Knicks! ALL NEW YORK, ALL THE TIME! \n12.

I’m the first person in my High School’s history to have been accepted to Harvard through the Early Action process\n16.

I am a life-long resident of Pixburd, Pensivania (unofficial motto: we may have lost our jobs, but at least the smog's gone).

I have four cats, all named for historical leaders: Winston, Jack and Bobby (shout out to two great Harvardians), and Judah (for Haile Selassie, the Lion of Judah).\n\n4.

My favorite books are Portnoy's Complaint, The Chosen, and any/all of the Percy Jackson books.\n\n8.

I love playing Stratego, Risk, Diplomacy, and other strategy board games.\n\n13. I became obsessed with politics during the 2012 election and went to an intensive poli sci summer workshop, where I met lots of future politicians and decided I'd rather be a political commentator.\n\n14. My favorite TV shows are Slings and Arrows, Game of Thrones, The Office, and How I Met Your Mother.\n\n15. My friends and I formed an ironic quiz bowl team. We make gang signs and wear color-coordinated witty t-shirts and sweatpants. That being said, I'm really interested in playing on Harvard's (insert letter near the end of the alphabet here) team.

I'm in love with Harry Potter, Doctor Who, Sherlock, and Supernatural. (I got a Doctor Who poster from my sister that I am definitely bringing to Harvard)\n6. I'm Op/Ed editor of the newsmagazine at my school. That in addition to debate means I've got a lot of opinions. :)\n7. I've taken the train to get to school since I was 11. \n8. I speak a grand total of 1 language, but I've been learning Spanish and hope to learn Arabic. \n9. One of my greatest achievements is the rap I wrote as my calc final at the end of my junior year.

I now live in Westchester, NY (a bit north of the City…  I feel like a New Yorker) and go to Scarsdale High School ( With Solange!) \n4.  The first time I visited Harvard was when I went to their debate tournament while suffering from a rather bizarre virus.  I fell asleep in the Science Center and apparently tourists took pictures of me. \n5.  I do Extemp… a subset of Speech in the greater category of Forensics.  \n6.  I’m really into economics <3 I did a research project for 3 years on the U.S. healthcare system and behavioral economics. \n7.  Im a classic film fan! Obsessed with Alfred Hitchcock, Audrey Hepburn, Bette Davis… \n8.  I have a rather ‘older person’s’ taste in music… Frank Sinatra, Henry Mancini, Andrea Bocelli \n9.  I have seen Phantom of the Opera 7 times (it's a guilty pleasure) \n10.  I love fashion design and fashion in general.  When I was younger I got lost in Bergdorf Goodman’s for several hours. It was amazing. \n11.  My mom is from Beijing, China.  I try to spend time each summer over there but the pollution is rather foul :( \n12. My mom used to also be a Captain in the PLA so she knew how to drive a tank before she knew how to drive a car, but now she prefers to wear high heels and travel. \n13.  When I was little in Australia, my dad bred horses, we owned chickens, had a couple of snakes in our garden, and allowed a possum family of five to live in our roof. When we moved to Florida I had 2 pet chicks, one of which I lost in a supermarket.  Now I have a Westie called Coconut (yes, after the American Girl Dog) \n14.  I come from a family of rowers and other athletes but I am probably one of the most hand-eye challenged people ever. \n15.  Some TV shows I watch include Summer Heights High, Curb Your Enthusiasm, Sherlock, Downton Abbey, and dare I say Gossip Girl… \n16.  I am in love with Manhattan, especially Central Park. \n17.

When I received the email I let it sit in my inbox for two hours so I wouldn't see if I got rejected. (But I didn't so it's all good)!\n3. I am looking to get back into dancing and theater/ performing.\n4. I have been swimming for half my life, but I might join club at Harvard!\n5. I am sooo jealous of all of you who know Latin-- definitely taking some courses while I'm here!\n6. Additionally I have never been out of the country as I don't have a passport...\n7. I used to have swim meets at Blodgett Pool when I was 10, my first few visits to Harvard. Having swam at Yale on many occasions since it's so close, I can compare and say that (naturally) Harvard is better.\n8. My favorite historic civilization is Ancient Greece.\n9. I'm into history, anthropology, and studying people. Or just observing people. I like airports, malls, and the DMV because they bring in the most interesting people.\n10.

I'm very particular about the certain processes, things, etc. For example, I have to eat the right half a sandwich, or all the socks have to match. I find myself making equations out of number sequences like digital clocks and the date.\n17. I am a compulsive shell-collector on every vacation. We actually packed two FedEx boxes of shells to carry back from Florida this year.\n18. I've been told that I'm addicted to chap stick. After living in New England my whole life, I think it's justified.\n19. My sixth grade teacher called me Crimson after I told him I worked so hard in sixth grade so I can get into Harvard.

I've been performing improv and music since I was a wee lad. \n2.  Specifically, I play guitar, sing, dabble in piano, and like to pretend I can play harmonica.\n3.  The music that I play and listen to the most can be categorized as \"indie and any rock written between 1965-75.\"  My favorite artists include Crosby Stills and Nash, Fleet Foxes, Arcade Fire, Fleetwood Mac, Wilco, Bob Dylan, and The National (and of course the Beatles).\n4.  I'm a math nerd.  \n5.  I'm planning on majoring in Economics, with a (less-than-certain) plan to ultimately work in development economics (I think it's really cool to be able to use math/analytic thinking to \"heal the world\" as Judaism puts it).\n6.  In general, I'm pretty into all things comedy, and have considered attempting to become a screenwriter if this \"economist\" thing doesn't work out.\n7.  I'm not proud of this, but I have two degrees of musical separation from Rebecca Black. \n8.  I love playing basketball.  I haven't played in a while, but look forward to intramural teams in college.\n9.  I am a devoted Bruce Springsteen fan, which leads to quite a bit of tension with my friends who are less appreciative of the Boss.  \n10. I live in a California beach town, but still don't know how to surf.  I'll probably learn this summer and then promptly leave for the less surfer-friendly coast.  \n11.  My brother is at the University of Oregon, and can often be found  in embarrassing outfits rooting for the team on national television.\n12.  It's a good thing that the odds are low that I'll be going to a school with a great football team, because this way I can still root for the Ducks.\n13.  I'm really disorganized and have atrocious handwriting, but somehow I manage.\n14.  I ran cross country for two years, but now just run casually on my own because I realized I liked the people more than I liked the sport.       \n15.  I'm struggling to find 20 facts.  I must not be all that interesting.\n16.  My dad often gets mistaken for Ben Bernake, so it'll probably be good if I don't go to Princeton, because I don't want to slip and call a professor \"dad.\"\n17.  I love the movie \"Blades of Glory,\" and now sometimes use the phrase \"mind-bottling\" without realizing it.  \n18.  I play poker a lot, though I'm guessing some of you future statistics concentrators would probably take all of my money pretty quickly.  \n19.  I dominate at Super Smash Bros.\n20.  I feel I've probably forgotten something really important, so I'll probably add to this later.","picture":"https://fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net/hprofile-ak-ash1/371648_100000811231013_1387502048_q.jpg"},{"from":{"name":"Raja Reddy","id":"100001188267225"},"to":{"data":[{"name":"Harvard Class of 2018","id":"601401026562908"}]},"message":"I'm late to the party--Indian standard time--but here are my statements/questions! :D 17's kind of a lucky number for me, and it's one less than 18, so I'll do 17 things.\n\n1. I have to give someone a Secret Santa present tomorrow and I have no idea what to get because I'm terrible at gifts. She loves chocolate and horses. Any advice?\n\n2. When I was little, I was afraid to go into the snake exhibit at the zoo because I thought I would make the glass vanish like Harry and release a bunch of snakes.  I don't like snakes.\n\n3. My parents and sister came from India, but I was born and raised in Harlingen, Texas in the Rio Grande Valley. :D Real close to the border.\n\n4. When I meet people outside the valley, I tell people I come from H-Town, and they always assume I mean Houston.\n\n5. The only Spanish phrases I knew for much of my childhood were \"Hola me llamo Raja soy de Mexico\" and \"sientate\". I still don't know very much.\n\n6. I go to the Science Academy of South Texas, which is pretty much the best school in the world. \n\n7. I was born on July 7, so any number containing a 7 is automatically deemed lucky for me. :D (But I've now added 18 to that list.)\n\n7. My first name is Rajadhar, Raja for short. \"Raja\" means king, but it can also mean moon. \"Rajadhar\" roughly translates to \"he who bears the moon\", which is Shiva, a Hindu god. A lot of the men in my family (including my dad and grandpa) have names that are variations of Shiva.\n\n8. HUGE fan of Harry Potter (of course) and Hunger Games. #teampeeniss AND HIS DARK MATERIALS, though I haven't read them in years.\n\n9. I have loved Avatar: The Last Airbender since the day it originally premiered during third grade. It is my absolute favorite show. (Legend of Korra is okay.) #watertribe\n\n10. Other favorite TV shows: Sherlock, Breaking Bad, HIMYM, New Girl, American Horror Story, Parks and Rec, Community, House of Cards, Arrested Development, Veronica Mars, Merlin. (This is how I stay busy during summers.)\n\n11. Favorite movie is The Lion King. Hands down. It and Finding Nemo are also the only Disney/Pixar movies my dad will watch, but I'm kind of a Disney fanatic. Strong believer of the \"never too old for a Disney movie\" philosophy. I also love Ghibli movies.\n\n12. Favorite books of the last year or so: Life of Pi, Great Gatsby, and Siddhartha. Least favorite book of this past year: Heart of Darkness. I can respect it, but I can't love it. #sorrynotsorry\n\n13. I love puns--lots of inside jokes in our StuCo--but I'm not very good at coming upun them. (See.) I also love #hashtags.\n\n14. I've done Model OAS for the past year and a half, so I'm really interested in Harvard's Model UN team. :D Also big on Science Bowl and Masterminds.\n\n15. I've never been to the Boston area (I don't think I've been gone any farther than NYC in the New England area). That'll have to change soon.\n\n16. Chicken and waffles potato chips are the bane of my existence.\n\n17. I love creative writing, but haven't done very much in the past few years. I hope I can pursue some ideas in the coming semester!\n\n17.

About 94.56899% of everything I say is just pure sarcasm, life’s too short to be so serious. \n2. I am able to speak English and Spanish, but am currently trying to learn Chinese. Sometimes I’ll just start intertwining all three just for the fun of it, 可是 usually 没有 sentido. \n3. I am a self-proclaimed staring contest champion. I’m ready for all challengers. \n4. I am currently procrastinating. How am I supposed to do homework when I’m still shocked at the fact that I can even be posting in this group? Senioritis is on full blast. \n5. I live in “Reveah,” it’s about 4 miles north of Boston. And for those of you who like fun facts, Revere Beach was the first public beach in the USA.\n6. I’ve been on my high school track team since my freshman year. I’m not particularly amazing, but its fun so I have no complaints.\n7. I think “Almond Joy” is possibly the best candy bar that has ever been created. You can’t go wrong with anything coconut-related.\n8. I usually listen to rock and rap, however, recently I’ve been listening to a lot of “Chillstep.” It’s basically dubstep, but it has some heavy bass and is very calming. My favorite bands/artists are: J Cole, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Bon Iver.\n9. I am currently listening to “Ellie Goulding - How Long Will I Love You (Aznar Remix)” \n10 .Not that I particularly like the Hunger Games, but since I went to go see Catching Fire, I’ve been doing the three-finger salute whenever I raise my hand in class.\n11. My favorite movie is “The Perks of Being a Wallflower.” \n12. My favorite books are “Catch-22” and “The Picture of Dorian Gray.” “One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish” by Dr. Seuss would probably take third place though, it’s a classic. \n13. I sincerely hope that when you all come to Boston you will have the opportunity to go to Boloco. As a fast-food burrito fan, I personally prefer Boloco over Chipotle. \n14. I spent about an hour shoveling snow before I started writing out all of these facts, I hope you all like cold weather. :)\n15. The only sport I take time to watch is football (futbol, soccer, etc..) Mark my words, this summer Colombia will be winning the World Cup. \n16. My favorite animal is the tortoise, specifically the red-footed tortoise. Google it right now and tell me that you wouldn’t want to have one as a pet. \n17. The most quotable show ever is Spongebob Squarepants. I plan on majoring in Wumbo! You know... I wumbo, you wumbo, he she me wumbo, wumbo, wumboing, Wilhelm B. Wumbo, wumbowama, wumbology, the study of wumbo?! This is first grade guys.  \n18.

This isn't really a fact but… What is homework? What are tests? How does one fend off crippling senoritis? \n11. The netflix bookmark on my laptop is seductively whispering my name. \n12. The thing that I most want to get out of my college experience is a better sense of self. Cannot wait to be exposed to such a diversity of perspectives and solidify/alter my opinions. Cheesy, but true!\n13. My grandpa had a dream one night that I would attend Yale… oops haha. \n14. A Bostonian would scoff at my sports affiliations. I'm a DIE HARD Yankees and Jets fan. I also bleed for the NY Red Bulls. I am looking forward to waltzing into Fenway all dressed in blue. \n15. It'd be hard to tell just by looking at me, but I'm 25% African, 25% Jamaican, 50% Eastern-European Jew. My bar mitzvah was a beautiful melting pot. \n16.

Writing this list intimidates me.\n2. I live in Summit, New Jersey; and like other people said, I promise it’s NOTHING like the Jersey Shore.\n3. I am very close with my family.\n4. I literally bawled when I saw the word, “Congratulations,” in my acceptance e-mail.\n5. Both my parents went to Princeton, so I guess they are just going to have to switch their allegiance to Harvard.\n6. Two years ago I was out of school for eight months because I had Lyme disease.\n7. I love music! I listen to pretty much everything, but my favorite is country.\n8. I started singing practically before I could talk. (See number 2) I’ve been singing in choirs since I was three. I really want to join an a capella group at Harvard.\n9. My favorite movies are The Blind Side and The Sound of Music\n10. I watch Food Network kind of obsessively. I plan to take a “Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives” road trip one day.\n11. I love reading Jane Austin novels.\n12. Full House is my all-time favorite TV Show. (But seriously, what happened to the Olsen twins?)\n13. Starbucks beats Dunkin’ Donuts, no question. (I may or may not be a coffee addict.)\n14. I am a Dallas Cowboys fan, which is probably a crime given the fact that I live in NY Giants territory.\n15. I own way too many wool sweaters.\n16. I love baking, and I am a cupcake fanatic!\n17. I plan to major in biomedical engineering.\n18. I take French and can’t wait to study abroad.\n19. I am honored to be in the same class as so many remarkably talented people.

Sometimes I feel like I'm addicted to Netflix... But is that a bad thing?\n\n4. Speaking of Netflix, is anyone else obsessed with House of Cards?\n\n5. I seriously love to read. My favorite authors are probably J.D. Salinger, Kurt Vonnegut, and Philip Roth.\n\n6. I love politics and watch the news all the time... Rachel Maddow = BEST news anchor. Period.\n\n7. I'm one of those speech and debate kids... 'Nuff said!\n\n8. In September I started writing a novel and haven't worked on it nearly as much as I have wanted.\n\n9. I've been working at a law firm since last summer.\n\n10. I'm really passionate about the environment and slowing the effects of climate change, which is unfortunately a minority position in Southwest Missouri.\n\n11. I should probably be studying for Finals, but instead I'm on Facebook. \n\n12. I've done scientific research for the last 3 years in microbiology, but this year I think I'm going to do a psychological study.\n\n13. I play the piano. I haven't had lessons though for about 2 years, so I'm a bit out of practice. \n\n14. I'm probably going to major in Government.\n\n15. I'm afraid that I might catch senioritis now...\n\n16. I read Ezra Klein's \"Wonkbook\" every morning Monday through Friday. This is hands-down the best speech and debate source.\n\n17. I hate to hop on the bandwagon, but I, like many of you, love Harry Potter. \n\n18. I really want to learn Mandarin Chinese. My Spanish teacher (who apparently knows Mandarin) has promised he'll teach me the basics next semester!\n\n19. I do Sudoku puzzles way too often. \n\n20.

I am staggeringly less impressive than everybody else admitted.\n2. I am also infinitely better-looking (its cheating if you actually look at my profile picture to check).\n4. I speak exactly one language (elfish); despite being Puerto Rican, I have only the knowledge that an AP student has of Spanish. That is to say, I cannot understand my relatives because they fail to speak Spanish like robots. \n8. My cousin told me I had a good Spanish accent but that I spoke too formally, and suggested I sprinkle cuss words into every sentence. I had far too much self-knowledge and pride to comply, because I didn't want to sound even more white. \n5. Nobody correct my grammar; when deciding whether to use semi or regular colons, its usually just a toss up (the lonely island can't learn me nothin!).\n18. I'm equally good at counting.\n7. I tried to have fun and learn French through ib ab initio (not sure bout that spelling) and it has easily been the worst decision of my academic career. C'est la vie (I think)\n13. I like music, but I don't like how bad of a singer I am or actually digging through the piles of terrible songs to find the gems. So I mooch off of my friend with a more indie and refined taste via her Spotify playlists. \n12. I'm somewhat afraid to do anything actually crazy on this page for fear of being kicked out of Harvard.\n20. I am from suburban Indiana and can confirm all of the corn stories. \n16. So, if zuckerburg is our pal now, im wondering when we get access to the super secret ad-free version of Facebook for celebrities and Harvard prefrosh.\n11. Ladies: you made it into Harvard, but now for the even more exclusive position of my girlfriend, I am now accepting applications.\n6. I'm not really a tool, please dont hate me.\n10. I'm annoyed because while my principal, adults in my life, and best friends have been fantastic, my other friends and acquaintances are being really passive aggressive about Harvard (I didn't even post any social media anything bout it!) \n17. Kon tiki- best story of mankind and it really happened. Both the film and book are excellent, and if you google it you will not be disappointed.\n14. I submitted an IU application November 1st and still have not been accepted...what? True story.\n16. I just ordered my first Harvard sweatshirt and am curious to see if people who know me will stop wearing theirs (they didn't even apply, I dont get why people do that).\n9. Wanted to go to Oxford as a kid and people would be like, \"No, really, where do you want to go?\" In your face, doubters.  Harvard is even more outrageous.  \n15. I am always \"that kid.\" Too quick to joke, too slow to do homework.  I have never once won student of the month! Even in grade school! It takes a special kind of teacher to love me.  Luckily I found two.  \n19. I am constantly hovering in between \"Man, you got this,\" and \"Oh god I'm going to flunk out,\" when it comes to how I think I'm going to do at Harvard.  \n3. I've only read about five of these so I can't be sure that all my jokes haven't been said before","picture":"https://fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net/hprofile-ak-prn2/276242_1818667943_938440804_q.jpg"},{"from":{"name":"Amira Hannon","id":"100000051192917"},"to":{"data":[{"name":"Harvard Class of 2018","id":"601401026562908"}]},"message":"Okay here's my 20, actually its 13 because I ran out of facts & December 13 was the best day of my life!\n1.

I love anything literary, historical, musical, artistic or otherwise related to the humanities. The only science I have a fondness for is biology, and even that goes so far.

Here's 20 facts about me:\n\n1. I'm from Biloxi, Mississippi. Population: not a lot.  \n2. I drive a 1999 Ford Escort. Its check engine light has been lit for quite some time, too, so I know that feeling. \n3. My first favorite TV show was Scooby Doo. My current favorite TV show is House, M.D.\n4. I enjoy hiking, though I can't do much of it in MS. There's a tiny town called Pond, Mississippi where I do a bit of hiking but it is a four hour drive to get there. \n5. I visited Boston/Cambridge in October for the first time and absolutely fell in love with the area. \n6. I like to chat up strangers in airports. \n7. I dabble in photography. But just dabble... I can't say I'm an *amazing* photographer. I prefer canons over nikons.  \n8. Serif fonts make me happy. Sorry calibri 11, Times New Roman 12 is--and always will be--my fav. \n9. That said, I am a PC person. But if I had the choice financially, I'd probably switch to Mac. \n10. I have eight siblings. I'm number 7 out of 9 kids. \n11. I am a big Pope Francis fan, even though he's gotten a lot of hate from mainstream Catholics. \n12. I write plays. I see writing as a way to relax and flex my imagination muscles. \n13. I'm on my high school's dance team, the Biloxi Belles. \n14. I have a dog. She likes naps and potato chips. She is named after the Beatles song Eleanor Rigby. \n15. I have a wide range of music tastes: Sinatra, Gene Kelly, Mumford & Sons, broadway, James Blunt, Queen, Daughter, Judy Garland, Beyoncé, Classical (Tchaikovsky, Debussy my favs), and a whole lot more.\n16. I am currently working on a production of Legally Blonde the Musical. \n17. I love thrift shopping. \n18. I had to drive two and a half hours to take the SAT. It's not offered in my area. \n19. I love Harry Potter and Nicolas Cage movies. \n20.

I'm a complete band geek (see what I did there?). I play bassoon at school and in a regional band, but I can also play flute a little. \n2. Continuing with band, I marched flute for one year and bass drum for three years. One of my favorite things to hear is  a good drum break!\n3. Gustav Holst is my favorite composer. The First Suite in E-flat and the Planets Suite, especially Jupiter, are some of my favorite pieces of music.\n4.I was born in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia, and I lived there until I was four and again from age 12-13.\n5. I speak fluent Spanish. It'd be harder to understand my parents if I didn't.\n6.I love French, but since I skipped French 3, I took AP French last year and don't have a chance to parler français very much anymore.\n7. I actually went to VA Governor's School for French. Three weeks of nothing but French. Even if we wanted to say something like \"Radiohead,\" we'd have to say, \"Tête de la radio.\"\n8.While there, we all took a class on Arabic, which I found extremely fascinating. It's so much fun to write, and the diversity of the dialects is very interesting.\n9.Etymology and linguistics are some of my favorite things to learn about. It's like  evolutionary science for the literary minded.\n10. I say I live in  Washington, DC because I feel like it's misleading to say I live in Virginia. Northern Virginia (NoVA) and the rest of Virginia are pretty different. \n11. I've moved around a lot, but, apart from Bolivia, all in the same general place; Alexandria, Herndon, Manassas, and Centreville are all towns in NoVA.\n12. My intended concentration is international relations, but economics and languages are also big interests of mine.\n13. My culture has some of the best food in the world, and I don't think I'm too biased. I can't wait to share some empanadas and salteñas with everyone!\n14. One of the things I most want in the world is a dog. I had one in Bolivia, a beautiful American Eskimo Dog named Alaska, but I had to leave her behind sadly.\n15. I actually made my dog a facebook when I was 12. One of my sillier moments.\n16. I haven't had to pay for a newspaper since I was 7 because my dad delivers for the Washington Post. I help him sometimes, and there're always extras. \n17. I like tennis a lot, but I'm not very good. Maybe I can improve in the next four years?\n18.  I learned English by watching TV when I was little, and they would always mention Harvard as a symbol for intelligence and success. Since then, it's always been my goal to attend. \n19. I know very little about Boston, but I suppose I know where to the \"park the car.\"\n20. This is such a dream come true, and I don't think I'll be asking for anything for Christmas since I got what I've always wanted already.","picture":"https://fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net/hprofile-ak-ash1/186921_1259663791_1759988909_q.jpg"},{"from":{"name":"Sarah Fellman","id":"100001626503143"},"to":{"data":[{"name":"Harvard Class of 2018","id":"601401026562908"}]},"message":"20 things all about me!\n1.

I am in Honors Spanish IV and I LOVE IT. I hope to become fluent in Spanish in college.\n6. I swim at school and for my neighborhood. I'm not good, but it's fun, and I love making friends with kids from all grades on the team.\n7. I am in charge of my school's peer tutoring program. I love tutoring people.\n8. I actually still studied this weekend because I'm nerdy and I like to study. I admit, Friday was a slacking day. \n9. I like \"From Quarks to Quasars\" on Facebook. If you're interested in anything sciency, especially physics and outer space, I recommend you like it as well.\n10. My cousin was in Harvard class of 2013. He gave me a tour of the bathrooms of Harvard, and he recommends the Stat bathroom, in case any of you were wondering.\n11. I live in North Carolina. I do not have a southern accent or a gun, and I do not live on a farm. Charlotte, NC represent.\n12. I'm a vegetarian planning on going vegan when I go to college, and I'm into animal rights.\n13. I do not squash or kill bugs, I catch them and save them by releasing them outside.\n14. I LOVE politics. I want to concentrate in government (subject to change, of course), and would love to enter into intelligent discourse about politics as VISITAS.\n15. This summer, I planned a program where a bunch of teens repaired after hurricane sandy. It was an absolutely incredible experience.\n16. I am super enthusiastic and SPIRITED about everything. WHOOOO.\n17. I am in online AP World History. It's fun because a ton of my friends are taking online AP classes in the same block as me and we hang out in the media center. Since we can do the work at school or at home, it doubles as a study hall/social time.\n18. I love The Big Bang Theory. The pleasure isn't even guilty. Team Shamy.\n19. I like to make weird and funny faces.\n20. I love meeting new people and making new friends.

(And also I can't think of a 20th fact):\n\n1. Whenever I see a plastic cup, I instinctively go for the cup song\n2. I listen to all different types of music- pop, classical music, Christmas music, DISNEY music. Macklemore is my jam. 24hoursofhappy.com is my new go-to for homework!\n3. I get emotionally invested in fictional characters and this is why Game of Thrones makes me sad/angry/why can't I life anymore. Also in Catching Fire when Peeta is all like \"I would be happy if it weren't for... THE BABY\" I cried for a fictional baby in a fictional story and this isn't even unusual for me\n4. Like BBC Sherlock is my fave <3\n5. I've played piano for 12 years and playing onstage at a concert hall is SO surreal\n6. My parents actually got my name from the book Joy Luck club and chose it because my mom's Chinese name translates to \"strong ocean\" wave\n7. I used to be allergic to milk and eggs but I grew out of it. I'm eternally grateful for this because chocolate pizza cookies ice cream (not all at once)\n8. But I'm still allergic to peanut butter\n9. I'm on swim team and love the sense of family!\n10. If I get between 3-6 hours of sleep I cannot function. I'm okay with more or less\n11.

Pandas and hedgehogs are too cute!\n13. Is my favorite number & yesterday reinforced this :)\n14. I used to use words like \"adorbs\" and \"swag\" and #hashtags facetiously, but now they've actually become part of my vocabulary. sometimes i just don't capitalize totes awk \n15. Sometimes people complain about their parents and I'm just over here like well I kind of like mine :|\n16. Confession: I actually live in Vancouver, WA but then people start going like Vancouver, BC!? Washington, DC!? And then I'm like NO. So Portland is close enough :)\n17. Food. Just all of it. \n18.

I am from SoCal (yes, there are more of us). Once, I saw a celebrity at Ralphs. It was Bill Nye the Science Guy and it made my life. \n\n4. I can quote Harry Potter like it's nbd. But it actually really is a big deal because Harry, Ronald, and Hermione are my best friends. \n\n5. Not that I am anti-social. I love people. Humans are my thing and I can't wait to meet all of you excellent and outstanding crimsons and crimdaughters. \n\n6. I speak english, arabic, and french. My family is from North Africa and, well, it's a long story. Maybe when we meet face-to-face I'll divulge the rest :)\n\n7. My favorite colors are red and green, but not together. As much as christmas time is great, I am #muslimandproud \n\n8. When I am not fake-applying to college and pretending to study for my imminent AP Bio final (jk who needs good grades anymore?), I browse buzzfeed and pinterest looking for dorm decorating ideas/hacks. \n\n9. Speaking of rooms, when my sister found out I got accepted to this fine (fine) institution, she said \"you can move into the guest room, your room is mine now\". \n\n9.5 I am at nine and running out of clever ways to make myself look more harvard-material-esque. \n\n10. I swim and play waterpolo. I guess I might have to forget about liquid water in December... \n\n11. I have two friends who go to MIT and I am not sure whether I should hate them or still be friends with them... However, I do have a plethora of great ideas on how to prank Yale (I was raised for this day). \n\n12. My homegirl Caitlin and I interned at JPL/NASA last summer. I can't believe we both applied... AND GOT IN!!\n\n13. I have seen snow twice in my life and I am pretty sure it was man-made both times. Should I be super exited or scared about my first Boston winter?\n\n14. Speaking of cold, Perk #2 of getting into Harvard? A whole new winter-appropriate wardrobe. (Perk #1 being getting into Harvard and getting to hang with all you talented people). \n\n15. I have the best friend group on the entire planet and I am going to miss them so much. BUUUT, you folks seem pretty decent and some of you might probably become president, cure cancer, run the world (or all three), so I guess I am ok with hanging out with ya'll for the next four years :) \n\n16. I applied as a Chem major, but the horrors of OChem have kind of caused me nightmares... I am torn between a path in medicine and a path in international diplomacy, and as polar as those seem, I can't decide. \n\n17. I have what I think one calls \"wanderlust\" and I am very jealous of all those of you who come from or have been abroad. I have been to 6 or 7 countries outside the US and have lived in Tunisia for a bit, but I really want to travel the world some more. Study abroad anyone? \n\n18. CLASS OF 2018 REPRESENT. There are so many right things with this class that I don't see why we wouldn't be the best one yet. \n\n19. Perks of Being a Wallflower is my favorite movie. The Kite Runner is my favorite book. Is that intellectual enough? Do I pass the test? \n\n20. I have re-read this post at least ten times to make sure I didn't make any grammar errors. I can't have myself look like a fool now, can I? \n\nMy email has been checked, re-checked, and tripled-checked to confirm that I was, in fact, accepted into THE Harvard Class of 2018.

I'm from Sudbury, MA.\n\n2. I play the double bass. It's pretty much my thing. I do a couple orchestras around Boston and a bunch of jazz ensembles. I know there are a few other bass players in this group, so it'll be cool to meet you guys.\n\n3. I love Latin. I've read Cicero, Caesar, Vergil, Catullus, Horace and Ovid, and I've taken Latin since sixth grade. It brings me great joy to see other classics nerds here. Salvete!\n\n4. I really like poetry. Latin poetry, obviously, is great, but I also enjoy the Romantics, Epics, and what modern poetry I've read. I did an English project last year where I read the complete works of T.S. Eliot, and it was amazing.\n\n5. I'm a total classical music nerd. Mahler, Shostakovich, Ives, you name it. \n\n6. I have a brother that goes to Bowdoin. He plays cello. He's cool.\n\n7. I read a lot. I'm totally all over the place with genres and such. The last book (outside of school) I read was The Joy Luck Club, and the book before that was The Sound and the Fury.

Probably 2001: A Space Odyssey. All things Kubrick, though. Also, I saw Moonrise Kingdom the other day and it was great. My judgements on movies are disproportionately weighed by the quality of the music score (not intentionally), which explains why all of my favorite movies have awesome scores (Ligeti? Britten? Yes!). \n\n10. My best friend got in to MIT yesterday, so I guess that makes him my ex-best friend. jk? He's a guitar player, and we're trying to throw together a combo if anyone's interested. We play a lot of modern jazz, so yeah.\n\n11. I like physics! I'm not particularly gifted at it, but it's pretty awesome. I did some comp sci at BU over the summer in Java. 'Twas fun. \n\n12. I was going to wait for christmas break to finish Breaking Bad, but during Thanksgiving break, when I should have been writing college apps, by willpower broke down and I finished the last season. Darn good show.\n\n13. I am the least athletic person ever. I'm alright at ping pong, but that is the extent of my prowess. \n\n14. So this week, I played in Carnegie Hall in NY and then received my Harvard acceptance. This has been a good week.\n\n15. I love trivia, but I'm atrocious at word games. Scrabble, in particular. \n\n16. Avatar: The Last Airbender rocks. It brings me great joy to see so many  fans here. \n\n17. Throughout the college process, I completely avoided College Confidential except for the day before we got our results from Harvard. I went on in order to prepare myself for rejection by looking at past applicants that were more qualified than I but who had been rejected. Worked pretty well, actually.

I drink tea instead of coffee because I'm afraid I'll eventually become addicted to coffee! My favorite is black tea with a little bit of lemon and honey (for those late nights).\n4.

I'm an avid JCLer and Certamen player. Maybe I've met some of you at past NJCL conventions!\n7. I like economics, finance, and managing money in general.\n8. I have very eclectic taste in music. In general, I like classical, rock, and some pop.

I've been spending the last 24 hours reading about all of you wonderful people (and not doing my physics homework)\n\n1. My first name is pronounced like \"Chanel\" (minus the C).  Substitute teachers and baristas make me stressed.\n2. I find grocery shopping to be really calming.  Ditto to driving (unless it's in a snowstorm//on the highway).\n3. Trader joes is my life. And Beyonce.  And the first family.\n4. I love any combination of salty/sweet food - like chocolate with sea salt, or peanut butter and pretzels.\n5. I play the clarinet in my school's band, and march with colorguard. My school's football team is really really bad, so the audience usually consists of marching band parents only.\n6. I've been procrastinating studying for all my tests next week by spending hours on this Facebook page....\n7. I have too many favorite authors to list, but: Terrence Hayes, Jhumpa Lahiri, Junot Diaz, Somerset Maugham, Philip Roth...William Golding..(I read way too much fiction/poetry/plays, although I'm starting to get into good non-fiction as well - any recommendations would be much appreciated!!)\n8. I'm an editor for an anthology called \"The Best American Non Required Reading\" through 826 MI, where we work with an editing team at 826 Valencia. Our editor has always been Dave Eggers, but this year it's Lemony Snicket (anyone else read The Series Of Unfortunate Events books as a kid?). I also edit for a lot mag called Winter Tangerine Review, which you should definitely submit to if you have poems/prose/art etc! (Shameless plug)\n9. I love technology (addicted to my iphone), but sometimes I wish I lived during a time without so much screen time.  I think one of the biggest challenges we face is how to use technology to bring people together rather than driving them apart and furthering the education/wealth gap. \n10. I write plays! Seeing my work performed is the greatest validation possible. I had a play up at the Blank theatre in LA last summer, and have had two performed at Michigan State University the last two years.\n12. Ditto for poetry. I'm still trying to figure out a way to combine my many interests - Econ/creative writing/public policy..\n13. I live in Ann Arbor, MI but I was actually born in Boston, and I've lived in Boulder, CO, and Randolph, NJ as well - all before I was six!\n14. Before senior year, I could never sleep in past 8 in the morning. I think senioritis has actually changed my body clock.\n15. NPR is my radio station of choice, although I do make exceptions for Lorde, Bastille, Coldplay, and Fitz and the Tantrums.\n16. I'm currently in my seventh year of studying French, which I absolutely love! I'm going to France this spring with my high school band, but I would love to study abroad in college or spend a summer abroad.\n17. Even though I live in Michigan, we barely get any snow days because my city is scarily adept at clearing the roads.\n18. I was a really athletic kid - I played soccer, basketball, tennis, and I swam, did gymnastics, and figure skated. I had a brief stint running track and cross country in 7th grade, but decided I would rather be chasing a ball than just running...the only one I still do regularly is play tennis.\n19. I love The Daily Show and the Colbert Report. Mad Men is my favorite TV show, and I'm currently halfway through season one of Lost (late, I know, but I'm determined to finish the show before the end of senior year!\n20.

I listen to music almost all the time, and I’ll listen to just about anything.\n10. I play guitar, bass, and a bit of piano. I sing too, but not that well, haha\n11. I love How I Met Your Mother. Its unhealthy…  ok maybe I don’t like it that much, but I like it a lot.\n12. I don’t eat sweets (candy, cake, ice cream). My friends think I’m crazy, but at least they give me fruit on occasions when one is expected to receive candy.\n13. I tell terrible jokes, but I’ve read that a few of you do too, so I think we’ll get along just great. We can sit under a tree and have “bad-joke circles”\n14.

My favorite pieces are probably Brahms' \"Double Concerto in A minor,\" Stravinsky's \"The Firebird,\" and Mahler's second symphony.\n5. Along a similar note, I play viola and love it; my style isn't entirely classical, though, since I never formally had a teacher. Musical improv is just as fun as playing classical pieces to me.\n6.

I'd LOVE to meet up with the FRC alumni at Harvard and maybe start mentoring with FRC Team 125 or the other teams around Boston.\n7. Despite that little piece of engineering, I'm actually debating between biomedical engineering and neurobiology. Which leads into the next fact...\n8. I LOVE THE BRAIN AND EVERYTHING ABOUT IT. If you ever want to know something about the brain, let me know.

Mason Hale and I met through Summer@Brown in 2012, then both applied and were accepted to HSHSP (High School Honors Science Program) at Michigan State in 2013, and now... well, we're here. Ben Zheng is one of our HSHSP 2013 brethren. (Both of you should do this, by the way) #trifecta\n10.

My facts:\n1. I am wearing a soccer jersey right now and most likely will be for the duration of my stay at Harvard.\n2. My only three confrontations with police have come while engaging in political activities (and I hope for more to come!).\n3. If you come to any New York Red Bulls soccer game before orientation, find me in Section 126.\n4. My top TV shows are Lost, the West Wing, the Simpsons, Homeland, and the Daily Show. \n5. A 13-foot tall christmas tree fell on me when I was three. The extent to which I can blame any of my quirks on that incident remains unresolved to this day.\n6. I'm taking AP Spanish Literature. Lo siento (that's probably incorrectly used) to those who have expressed an affinity for Gabriel Garcia Marques, Pablo Neruda, and Jorge Luis Borges. I'm sure there's a lot of quality there, I just don't have the ability to see it (I'll blame the crazy teacher for that one).\n7. My girlfriend of three years will be attending school down the road at Brandeis which is swell.\n8. Anyone in the NYC-Connecticut area who likes soccer - we should have a World Cup watch party! Except for USA games. I must watch those alone for the safety of myself and others.\n9. My dog has been licking my knee extensively over the past few days. I am pondering the literal, figurative, and existential (?) significance of this phenomenon.\n10. I am a proud aficionado of the Starbucks peppermint white chocolate mocha. Recently named the third least healthy drink in America!\n11. I look forward to attending Red Sox - Champs! - and Revolution games while at Harvard, in addition to Harvard football games, especially versus Yale (for the obvious reason) and Dartmouth (because my sister goes there and is in the marching band).\n12. My favorite word is panache. I have an unfinished writing supplement about why this word is my favorite, which I thankfully no longer have to finish!\n13. I found out about my acceptance at 1:30 this morning after not receiving any emails during the day. Meanwhile, I was frantically checking my emails while watching Pitbull, Macklemore, and Miley Cyrus at Madison Square Garden - a strange combination of experiences.\n14. My first attempt at writing a Harvard supplement occurred while I was doped up on morphine following surgery in October. If I had submitted it, I most likely would not be in this group ...\n15. I am eagerly anticipating the liberal dining plan available at Harvard compared to the miserly options available at Dartmouth and elsewhere; such an interest compelled me to consider applying to Bates merely because they have 72 (!) different cereals available at every meal.\n16. I have vampire teeth - pointy incisors - however I was born in Santa Monica, California, not Forks, Washington.\n17. I'm one of eight so far from Greenwich High School in Greenwich, CT to be a member of the class of 2018.\n18. I intended to go outside to make a snowman but got caught up writing this and it is now too dark. Nevermind, that's a lie. It's way too cold. I've been making excuses to myself for my inaction.\n19. I was originally right footed but when I was five I forced myself to become left footed. My right foot's first touch suffered dreadfully. \n20. I hope to get involved in debate, model UN, a religious group, and/or political activities in addition to the many other diverse extracurriculars Harvard and Boston have to offer.
