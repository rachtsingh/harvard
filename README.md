harvard
=======

A quick and dirty webapp to display searchable and filterable info about the class of 2018

###thanks to:
+ AngularJS
+ CryptoJS
+ Bootstrap

###notes
if you try to load this, note that the harvard.dat file is AES-256 encrypted, to protect everyone's information. If you're a member of the Harvard Class of 2018 group, just login with Facebook. The script used to generate the `harvard.dat` file can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/simplydragons/8639019), though obviously private information (encryption key, feed url) is deleted.

Encryption is unfortunately not the best solution, but the easiest solution when a backend server isn't available and you need some sort of facebook verification. 

small things:
+ feel free to send me pull requests, etc.
+ if you're on this website, and don't want to be, send me a PM via facebook
+ comments are much appreciated
